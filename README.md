The sub items are more advanced features. We can always do the basics and then add additional features as we have time. 
Here "Card" is a book record. 

1. Title search the catalog for a book.
    a. User searches for part of a title.
2. Search for another field, such as author. 
3. Add card.
4. Delete card.
5. Check out/Return book (Cards will be marked accordingly, along with date and due date and patron name).
   a. We can use separate data structure for patrons and point to them when they check out books. 
   b. Keep a record of check outs. This can be attached to the cards.
6. Sorting operations on patrons and books. If we use a tree we don't really need this, but it will be essential for other data structures.
