Unlike the previously studied photocurrents in chiral materials, the proposed current requires neither circularly polarized light, nor an absence of symmetry with respect to a plane of reflection. We show that if a Weyl semimetal has a broken inversion symmetry then linearly polarized light can induce a photocurrent transverse to the direction of an applied magnetic field, in spite of the symmetry with respect to a reflection plane and the time reversal symmetry. The class of materials in which we expect this to occur is sufficiently broad and includes the transition metal monopnictides such as TaAs. The effect stems from the dynamics of Weyl chiral quasi-particles in a magnetic field, restricted by the symmetries described above; because the resulting current is transverse to the direction of magnetic field, we call it the transverse chiral magnetic photocurrent. The magnitude of the resulting photocurrent is predicted to be significant in the THz frequency range, about 0.75?A for type-I and 2.5?A for type-II Weyl semimetals. This opens the possibility to utilize the predicted transverse chiral magnetic photocurrent for sensing unpolarized THz radiation.  bSC0012704  b SC00176624 aChirality4 aTopological effects in photonic systems4 aWeyl fermions4 aWeyl semimetal4 aTerahertz techniques2 aUnited States.

Instead of full-scale coarse-graining, this approximation only truncates terms in the Redfield equation that average out over a time-scale typical of the quantum system. The first step in this approximation is to properly renormalize the system Hamiltonian, to symmetrize the gains and losses of the state due to the environmental coupling. In the second step, we swap out an arithmetic mean of the spectral density with a geometric one, in these gains and losses, thereby restoring complete positivity. This completely positive approximation, GAME (geometric-arithmetic master equation), is adaptable between its time-independent, time-dependent, and Floquet form. In the exactly solvable, three-level, Jaynes-Cummings model, we find that the error of the approximate state is almost an order of magnitude lower than that obtained by solving the coarse-grained stochastic master equation. As a test-bed, we use a ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-chain with long-range dipole-dipole coupling between up to 25-spins, and study the differences between various master equations. We find that GAME has the highest accuracy per computational resource.  bFG02-06ER462814 a75 condensed matter physics, superconductivity and superfluidity4 aQuantum dynamics4 aEnergy transfer2 aUnited States.

Many studies have investigated these effects using climate models; however, uncertainties remain in the modelled response to these eruptions. This is due in part to the diversity of forcing datasets that are used to prescribe the distribution of stratospheric aerosols resulting from these volcanic eruptions, as well as uncertainties in optical property derivations from these datasets. To improve this situation for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), a two-step process was undertaken. First, a combined stratospheric aerosol dataset, the Global Space-based Stratospheric Aerosol Climatology (GloSSAC; 1979?2016), was constructed. Next, GloSSAC, along with information from ice cores and Sun photometers, was used to generate aerosol distributions, characteristics and optical properties to construct a more consistent stratospheric aerosol forcing dataset for models participating in CMIP6. This ?version 3? of the stratospheric aerosol forcing has been endorsed for use in all contributing CMIP6 simulations. Recent updates to the underlying GloSSAC from version 1 to version 1.1 affected the 1991?1994 period and necessitated an update to the stratospheric aerosol forcing from version 3 to version 4. As version 3 remains the official CMIP6 input, quantification of the impact on radiative forcing and climate is both relevant and timely for interpreting results from experiments such as the CMIP6 historical simulations. This study uses two models, the Canadian Earth System Model version 5 (CanESM5) and the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model version 1 (EAMv1), to estimate the difference in instantaneous radiative forcing in simulated post-Pinatubo climate response when using version 4 instead of version 3. Differences in temperature, precipitation and radiative forcings are generally found to be small compared to internal variability. An exception to this is differences in monthly temperature anomalies near 24 km altitude in the tropics, which can be as large as 3 °C following the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.  bAC52-07NA27344  b 18-ERD-0544 aGeosciences2 aLawrence Livermore National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

This study aims to investigate the impacts of MAM TPSH on the interannual variability of East Asian dust cycle by using CAM4-BAM (version 4 of the Community Atmosphere Model coupled to a bulk aerosol model), MERRA-2 (version 2 of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) surface dust concentration, and TPSH measurements. Our simulations show that the surface dust concentrations over the East Asian (EA) dust source region and over the northwestern Pacific (NP) in MAM are significantly positively correlated with TPSH, with regionally averaged correlation coefficients of 0.49 for EA and 0.44 for NP. Similar positive correlations are also shown between the MAM TPSH measurements averaged over the 73 observation sites and the surface dust concentration from MERRA-2. Simulation-based comparisons between strongest and weakest TPSH years reveal that, the MAM surface dust concentration in the strongest TPSH years increases with relative differences of 13.1 % over EA and 36.9 % over NP. These corresponding differences are found in MERRA-2 with 22.9 % and 13.3 % over EA and NP, respectively. Further simulated results show that the processes of whole dust cycles (e.g., dust loading, emission, and transport, as well as dust deposition) are also significantly enhanced during the strongest TPSH years over EA and NP. Through enhancing the TP heat source, stronger TPSH in MAM generates an anticyclonic anomaly in middle and upper troposphere over the TP and over the downstream Pacific region, respectively. These atmospheric circulation anomalies induced by the increased TPSH result in increasing the westerly winds over both EA and NP, which in turn increases dust emissions over the dust source, and dust transport over these two regions, as well as the regional dust cycles. These results suggest that addressing the East Asian dust changes in the future climates requires considering not only increasing greenhouse gas emissions but also the variations of the TP's heat source under global warming.  bSC00127044 a54 environmental sciences2 aBrookhaven National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

To be economically viable for industrial applications and mass production, materials should have desired useful properties at a reasonable cost and should be safe for humans and the environment during manufacturing, handling, operational use, and after disposal. The discovery of novel materials is followed by a gradual improvement of properties by compositional adjustment and thermal or mechanical treatment. Consequently, with time, good materials become inferior to the best. There are several known classes of inexpensive materials with a giant magnetocaloric effect, and the search continues.

The expected loss of fusion alpha power due to ripple-induced transport is computed for the SPARC tokamak design by the ASCOT and SPIRAL orbit-simulation codes, to assess the expected surface heating of plasma-facing components. We find good agreement between the ASCOT and SPIRAL simulation results not only in integrated quantities (fraction of alpha power loss) but also in the spatial, temporal and pitch-angle dependence of the losses. If the toroidal field (TF) coils are well-aligned, the SPARC edge ripple is small (0.15?0.30 %), the computed ripple-induced alpha power loss is small ( ~0.25% ) and the corresponding peak surface power density is acceptable ( 244 kW m<sup>-2</sup> ). However, the ripple and ripple-induced losses increase strongly if the TF coils are assumed to suffer increasing magnitudes of misalignment. Surface heat loads may become problematic if the TF coil misalignment approaches the centimetre level. Ripple-induced losses of the energetic ion tail driven by ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) heating are not expected to generate significant wall or limiter heating in the nominal SPARC plasma scenario. Because the expected classical fast-ion losses are small, SPARC will be able to observe and study fast-ion redistribution due to MHD including sawteeth and Alfvén eigenmodes (AEs). SPARC's parameter space for AE physics even at moderate Q is shown to reasonably overlap that of the demonstration power plant ARC (Sorbom et al., Fusion Engng Des., vol. 100, 2015, p. 378), and thus measurements of AE mode amplitude, spectrum and associated fast-ion transport in SPARC would provide relevant guidance about AE behaviour expected in ARC.  bAC02-05CH11231  b RPP005  b 1122374  b 3247594 aFusion plasma4 aPlasma simulation4 aPlasma confinement2 aPrinceton University.

Detailed pulse length dependent measurements revealed that rapid spectral energy shift and broadening started within the first 10 fs of the X-ray illumination at intensity levels between 10<sup>17</sup> and 10<sup>18</sup> W cm<sup>-2</sup>. We attribute these spectral changes to the rapid evolution of high-density photoelectron mediated secondary collisional ionization processes upon the absorption of the incident XFEL radiation. These fast electronic processes, occurring at timescales well within the typical XFEL pulse durations (i.e., tens of fs), set the boundary conditions of the pulse intensity and sample parameters where the widely-accepted ?probe-before-destroy? measurement strategy can be adopted for electronic-structure related XFEL experiments.  bAC02-76SF005154 a99 general and miscellaneous4 aXes4 aXfel2 aUnited States.

We propose a workflow that couples highly relevant physics into machine learning (ML) to predict properties of complex high-temperature alloys with an example of the 9?12 wt% Cr steels yield strength. We have incorporated synthetic alloy features that capture microstructure and phase transformations into the dataset. Identified high impact features that affect yield strength of 9Cr from correlation analysis agree well with the generally accepted strengthening mechanism. As a part of the verification process, the consistency of sub-datasets has been extensively evaluated with respect to temperature and then refined for the boundary conditions of trained ML models. The predicted yield strength of 9Cr steels using the ML models is in excellent agreement with experiments. The current approach introduces physically meaningful constraints in interrogating the trained ML models to predict properties of hypothetical alloys when applied to data-driven materials.  bAC05-00OR227254 aComputational methods4 aMetals and alloys2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

The E3SM SCM was adopted from the SCM used in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) but has evolved significantly since then. We describe changes made to the aerosol specification in the SCM, idealizations, and developments made so that the SCM uses the same dynamical core as the full general circulation model (GCM) component. Based on these changes, we describe and demonstrate the seamless capability to ?replay? a GCM column using the SCM. We give an overview of the E3SM case library and briefly describe which cases may serve as useful proxies for replicating and investigate some long-standing biases in the full GCM runs while demonstrating that the E3SM SCM is an efficient tool for both model development and evaluation.  bSC0012704  b SC0018650  b AC52-07NA273444 a54 environmental sciences2 aBrookhaven National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

However, simulations are carried out at a finite temperature, where quantum critical features are masked by finite-temperature effects. Here, we present a theoretical framework within which it is possible to separate thermal and quantum effects and extract the information about NFL physics at T = 0. We demonstrate our method for a specific example of 2D fermions near an Ising ferromagnetic QCP. We show that one can extract from QMC data the zero-temperature form of fermionic self-energy ?(?) even though the leading contribution to the self-energy comes from thermal effects. We find that the frequency dependence of ?(?) agrees well with the analytic form obtained within the Eliashberg theory of dynamical quantum criticality, and obeys ?<sup>2/3</sup> scaling at low frequencies.

Particularly intriguing materials in this regard are low dimensional aperiodic structures with non-conventional symmetries that are otherwise forbidden in translation symmetric crystals. In our work, we focus on the link between the structural and electronic properties of aperiodically ordered aromatic molecules on a quasicrystalline surface, which has largely been neglected so far. As an exemplary case, we investigate the self-assembly and the interfacial electronic properties of the nano-graphene-like molecule coronene on the bulk truncated icosahedral (i) Al?Pd?Mn quasicrystalline surface using multiple surface sensitive techniques. We find an aperiodically ordered coronene monolayer (ML) film on the i-Al?Pd?Mn surface that is characterized by the same local motifs of the P1 Penrose tiling model as the bare i-Al?Pd?Mn surface. The electronic valence band structure of the coronene/i-Al?Pd?Mn system is characterized by the pseudogap of thebare i-Al?Pd?Mn, which persists the adsorption of coronene confirming the quasiperiodic nature of the interface. In addition, we find a newly formed interface state of partial molecular character that suggests an at least partial chemical interaction between the molecule and the quasicrystalline surface. We propose that this partial chemical molecule?surface interaction is responsible for imprinting the quasicrystalline order of the surface onto the molecular film.  bAC02-07CH11358  b TRR-173-2685653702 aUnited States.

These images were produced using 230 GHz observations performed in 2017 April. Additional observations are required to investigate the persistence of the primary image feature - a ring with azimuthal brightness asymmetry - and to quantify the image variability on event horizon scales. To address this need, we analyze M87* data collected with prototype EHT arrays in 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013. While these observations do not contain enough information to produce images, they are sufficient to constrain simple geometric models. We develop a modeling approach based on the framework utilized for the 2017 EHT data analysis and validate our procedures using synthetic data. Applying the same approach to the observational data sets, we find the M87* morphology in 2009-2017 to be consistent with a persistent asymmetric ring of ~40 uas diameter. The position angle of the peak intensity varies in time. In particular, we find a significant difference between the position angle measured in 2013 and 2017. These variations are in broad agreement with predictions of a subset of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We show that quantifying the variability across multiple observational epochs has the potential to constrain the physical properties of the source, such as the accretion state or the black hole spin.  bAC02-07CH113594 a79 astronomy and astrophysics2 aFermi National Accelerator Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

However, little research has been reported for microstructure evolutions of advanced high-strength steels during the process. The present work focuses on the study of transient microstructure changes and local mechanical properties for friction stir spot processed dual-phase (DP) 980 MPa grade steel (DP980) under different peak temperatures. A pinless silicon nitride ceramic tool was used to produce relatively simple material deformation and flow near the tool. Friction stir spot processed steel samples were characterized by optical and electron microscopies. Furthermore, Vickers microhardness and nano-indentation measurements were used to study local mechanical properties for correlation with microstructures. A swallow layer of refined grains (<0.6 µm) was obtained with a low peak temperature (under 400 °C), whereas higher peak temperatures (>Ac<sub>1</sub>) led to a change in grain size with different microstructures (fine-grained DP or martensite). Electron back-scattered diffraction characterizations revealed a large deformation in the as-received microstructures (mixture of ferrite and tempered martensite) induced by friction stir spot processing, leading to recrystallization and grain refinement around the stirred zone. Also, nano-indentation measurements showed a higher hardness than the hardness of the as-received DP980. Friction stir processing with different process conditions effectively changed microstructures and local mechanical properties.  bAC05-00OR22725  b NFE-17-069284 aFriction stir processing4 aAdvanced high-strength steel4 aCharacterization4 aMicrostructures2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Valorization of lignin relies on effective and green methods of de-lignification, with a growing interest in the use of microbes. Here we investigate the physiology and molecular response of the novel facultative anaerobic bacterium, <em>Tolumonas lignolytica</em> BRL6-1, to lignin under anoxic conditions. Physiological and biochemical changes were compared between cells grown anaerobically in either lignin-amended or unamended conditions. In the presence of lignin, BRL6-1 accumulates higher biomass and has a shorter lag phase compared to unamended conditions, and 14% of the proteins determined to be significantly higher in abundance by log<sub>2</sub> fold-change of 2 or greater were related to Fe(II) transport in late logarithmic phase. Ferrozine assays of the supernatant confirmed that Fe(III) was bound to lignin and reduced to Fe(II) only in the presence of BRL6-1, suggesting redox activity by the cells. LC-MS/MS analysis of the secretome showed an extra band at 20 kDa in lignin-amended conditions. Protein sequencing of this band identified a protein of unknown function with homology to enzymes in the radical SAM superfamily. Expression of this protein in lignin-amended conditions suggests its role in radical formation. From our findings, we suggest that BRL6-1 is using a protein in the radical SAM superfamily to interact with the Fe(III) bound to lignin and reducing it to Fe(II) for cellular use, increasing BRL6-1 yield under lignin-amended conditions. This interaction potentially generates organic free radicals and causes a radical cascade which could modify and depolymerize lignin. Further research should clarify the extent to which this mechanism is similar to previously described aerobic chelator-mediated Fenton chemistry or radical producing lignolytic enzymes, such as lignin peroxidases, but under anoxic conditions.  bAC05-76RL01830  b AC02-05CH11231  b FP-91782301-02 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

A unique nanocomposite structure of Pb@PbO core-shell nanoparticles in a carbon matrix was obtained by a simple high-energy ball milling method using the low-cost starting materials PbO and carbon black. Electrochemical performance tests showed its excellent reversible capacity (ca. 600 mAh/g) and cycle stability (92% retention at 100th cycle), which are one of the best values reported for Pb-based anodes in the literature. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and absorption techniques revealed the detailed lithium storage mechanism that can be highlighted with the unexpectedly wide reversible Pb redox range (between Pb2+ and Pb4-) and the evolution of Zintl-type LiyPb structures during the electrochemical lithium reaction.

Yet, landscape-scale studies of major coastal rivers from the river mouth to the head of tide, such as this study, remain rare. Here, we develop a new predictive framework for estuarine?tidal river research and management using a river-specific low-water datum and the wetland inundation indicator SEVg, the growing-season sum exceedance value of hourly surface-water depth. The distribution and variability of the wetland species pool (n = 203) on the 234 river kilometer (rkm) lower Columbia River and estuary floodplain are described for the first time. 4,940 quadrats at 50 marshes were surveyed (2005?2016). Throughout the estuarine?tidal river system, SEVg was well suited to describe the wetland inundation regime and its variability based on the combination of longitudinal river position and elevation. SEVg increased significantly landward. Two primary wetland inundation regimes were identified: the seaward-tidal, usually greatest during the winter months, and landward-fluvial, greatest during the growing season. Nearest the ocean, salinity is the abiotic factor limiting species richness and non-native species. Farther upriver, the daily, seasonal, and interannual variability of the wetting and drying cycle encourage disturbance-tolerant species and non-natives and limit the number of hydrophytes and total vegetative cover. Hence, the average between-year similarity of site-scale areal cover significantly decreased landward. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated five vegetative groups and five ecohydrologic zones between rkm 0 and 234 were discriminated with 76 significant species?zone associations. All zones had unique indicator species. Species with high indicator values were Carex lyngbyei throughout the estuarine zones, and Eleocharis palustris, Sagittaria latifolia, and the invasive non-native Phalaris arundinacea in the upper estuarine and lower, middle, and upper tidal river zones (IV > 0.90). Competition from C. lyngbyei nearest the ocean and P. arundinacea in the tidal river was associated with reduced species richness when total cover was >65%. This framework of filters informs the design and prediction of future wetland plant communities on coastal river floodplains.  bAC05-76RL018304 aAbiotic filter, community assembly, hydrological regime, species pool, terrestrial aquatic, tidal freshwater, tidal river, wetland2 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aBorde, Amy B. 4aut1 aDiefenderfer, Heida L. 4aut1 aCullinan, Valerie I. 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/166186003579nam a22003853u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124245017400137260019200311300004600503500003900549500001600588500003400604500014400638500005100782520190000833536001402733536001502747536001602762536001702778650003002795710004002825710006002865710009002925720002203015720002803037720002603065720005603091856004603147OST1673428TOE20201020000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200913|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1673428  aTOEcTOE00aPAMTRA 1.0h[electronic resource] :b the Passive and Active Microwave radiative TRAnsfer tool for simulating radiometer and radar measurements of the cloudy atmosphere   aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

In this way, they are an integral part of inversion algorithms that aim to retrieve geophysical variables from observations or in data assimilation. Their application for the exploitation of the full information content of remote sensing observations becomes increasingly important when these are used to evaluate the performance of cloud-resolving models (CRMs). Herein, CRM profiles or fields provide the input to the forward model whose simulation results are subsequently compared to the observations. This paper introduces the freely available comprehensive microwave forward model PAMTRA (Passive and Active Microwave TRAnsfer), demonstrates its capabilities to simulate passive and active measurements across the microwave spectral region for upward- and downward-looking geometries, and illustrates how the forward simulations can be used to evaluate CRMs and to interpret measurements to improve our understanding of cloud processes. PAMTRA is unique as it treats passive and active radiative transfer (RT) in a consistent way with the passive forward model providing upwelling and downwelling polarized brightness temperatures and radiances for arbitrary observation angles. The active part is capable of simulating the full radar Doppler spectrum and its moments. PAMTRA is designed to be flexible with respect to instrument specifications and interfaces to many different formats of input and output, especially CRMs, spanning the range from bin-resolved microphysical output to one- and two-moment schemes, and to in situ measured hydrometeor properties. A specific highlight is the incorporation of the self-similar Rayleigh?Gans approximation (SSRGA) for both active and passive applications, which becomes especially important for the investigation of frozen hydrometeors.  bSC0013306  b 268020496  b CR 111/9-1  b KN 1112/2-14 a54 environmental sciences2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Here, we report that the transport processes that rely on strong spin-momentum locking in the topological insulator Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> are completely suppressed by scattering at a heterointerface with the kagome-lattice paramagnet, Co<sub>7</sub>Se<sub>8</sub>. Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>?Co<sub>7</sub>Se<sub>8</sub>?Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> trilayer heterostructures were grown using molecular beam epitaxy, where magnetotransport measurements revealed a substantial suppression of the weak antilocalization effect for Co<sub>7</sub>Se<sub>8</sub> at thicknesses as thin as a monolayer, indicating a strong dephasing mechanism. Bi<sub>2-<i>x</i></sub>Co<sub><i>x</i></sub>Se<sub>3</sub> films, in which Co is in a non-magnetic 3<sup>+</sup> state, show weak antilocalization that survives to higher than <i>x</i> = 0.4, which, in comparison with the heterostructures, suggests that the unordered moments of Co<sup>2+</sup> act as a far stronger dephasing element. This work highlights several important points regarding coherent transport processes involving spin-momentum locking in topological insulator interfaces and how magnetic materials can be integrated with topological materials to realize both exotic phases and novel device functionality.  bAC05-00OR227254 aFocused ion beam4 aHeterostructures4 aEpitaxy4 aElectronic transport4 aKagome lattices4 aTopological insulator4 aCrystal lattices4 aMagnetic fields4 aX-ray diffraction4 aMagnetic materials2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

The spatial pattern of change provides a ?fingerprint? that is generally much larger than natural variability. Insofar as the response to radiative forcing is linear (the impact of quadrupling CO<sub>2</sub> is twice the impact of doubling CO<sub>2</sub>) this fingerprint can then be used to estimate the impact of historical greenhouse gas forcing. However, the degree to which biogeochemical cycles respond linearly to radiative forcing has rarely been tested. In this paper, we evaluate which ocean biogeochemical fields are likely to respond linearly to changing radiative forcing, which ones do not, and where linearity breaks down. We also demonstrate that the representation of lateral mixing by mesoscale eddies, which varies significantly across climate models, plays an important role in modulating the breakdown of linearity. Globally integrated surface rates of biogeochemical cycling (primary productivity, particulate export) respond in a relatively linear fashion and are only moderately sensitive to mixing. By contrast, the habitability of the interior ocean (as determined by hypoxia and calcite supersaturation) behaves non-linearly and is very sensitive to mixing. This is because the deep ocean, as well as certain regions in the surface ocean, are very sensitive to the magnitude of deep wintertime convection. The cessation of convection under global warming is strongly modulated by the representation of eddy mixing.  bSC00193444 aEddy mixing4 aClimate change4 aClimate sensitivity4 aPrimary productivity4 aExport4 aOcean deoxygenation4 aCalcite undersaturation4 aOceanic convection2 aUnited States.

In particular, they are consistent with the Gaussian predictions of the ?CDM cosmological model, yet also confirm the presence of several so-called ?anomalies? on large angular scales. The novelty of the current study, however, lies in being a first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of the statistics of the polarization signal over all angular scales, using either maps of the Stokes parameters, <em>Q</em> and <em>U</em>, or the <em>E</em>-mode signal derived from these using a new methodology (which we describe in an appendix). Although remarkable progress has been made in reducing the systematic effects that contaminated the 2015 polarization maps on large angular scales, it is still the case that residual systematics (and our ability to simulate them) can limit some tests of non-Gaussianity and isotropy. However, a detailed set of null tests applied to the maps indicates that these issues do not dominate the analysis on intermediate and large angular scales (i.e., <em>?</em> ? 400). In this regime, no unambiguous detections of cosmological non-Gaussianity, or of anomalies corresponding to those seen in temperature, are claimed. Notably, the stacking of CMB polarization signals centred on the positions of temperature hot and cold spots exhibits excellent agreement with the ?CDM cosmological model, and also gives a clear indication of how <em>Planck</em> provides state-of-the-art measurements of CMB temperature and polarization on degree scales.  bAC02-05CH112314 aCosmology: observations4 aCosmic background radiation4 aPolarization4 aMethods: data analysis4 aMethods: statistical2 aLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

This model, called the curled wake model, captures a wake phenomenon that occurs behind yawed turbines, modeled as a collection of vortices shed from the rotor plane. Through turbine simulations, these vortices are shown to have a significant impact on the prediction of the wake steering's performance. Overall, the results support the concept of secondary steering, or a yawed turbine's ability to deflect the wake of a downstream turbine, and suggest that future turbine wake studies and yaw optimizations should include the curled wake phenomenon.  bAC36-08GO283084 a49 ee - wind and water power program - wind (ee-4w)4 aFloris4 aWind energy4 aWind farm control4 aOffshore wind energy4 aFlow control2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

Images from RADARSAT-1, Envisat, and Sentinel-1A/B are processed to wind maps using the geophysical model function (GMF) CMOD5.N. Extensive comparisons with 6008 collocated buoy observations of the wind speed reveal that biases of the individual systems range from -0.8 to 0.6 m s<sup>-1</sup>. Unbiased wind retrievals are crucial for producing an accurate wind atlas, and intercalibration of the SAR observations is therefore applied. Wind retrievals from the intercalibrated SAR observations show biases in the range of to -0.2 to 0.0 m s<sup>-1</sup>, while at the same time improving the root-mean-squared error from 1.67 to 1.46 m s<sup>-1</sup>. The intercalibrated SAR observations are, for the first time, aggregated to create a wind atlas at the height 10 m a.s.l. (above sea level). The SAR wind atlas is used as a reference to study wind resources derived from the Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit (WTK), which is based on 7 years of modelling output from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Comparisons focus on the spatial variation in wind resources and show that model outputs lead to lower coastal wind speed gradients than those derived from SAR. Areas designated for offshore wind development by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management are investigated in more detail; the wind resources in terms of the mean wind speed show spatial variations within each designated area between 0.3 and 0.5 m s<sup>-1</sup> for SAR and less than 0.2m s<sup>-1</sup> for the WTK. Our findings indicate that wind speed gradients and variations might be underestimated in mesoscale model outputs along the US East Coast.  bAC36-08GO283084 a17 wind energy4 aOffshore wind energy4 aWind toolkit4 aSynthetic aperture radar4 aWind atlas2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

Here, relationships among vertically distributed aerosol optical properties (?ap, ?sp and single scattering albedo or SSA), particle microphysics and particle chemistry are examined for a region of the Canadian archipelago between 79.9 and 83.4° N from near the surface to 50 hPa. Airborne data collected during April 2015 are combined with ground-based observations from the observatory at Alert, Nunavut and simulations from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model, GEOS-Chem, coupled with the TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) model (collectively GEOS-Chem?TOMAS; Kodros et al., 2018) to further our knowledge of the effects of BC on light absorption in the Arctic troposphere. The results are constrained for ?sp less than 15 Mm<sup>-1</sup>, which represent 98% of the observed ?sp, because the single scattering albedo (SSA) has a tendency to be lower at lower ?sp, resulting in a larger relative contribution to Arctic warming. At 18.4 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>, the average BC mass absorption coefficient (MAC) from the combined airborne and Alert observations is substantially higher than the two averaged modelled MAC values (13.6 and 9.1 m2 g<sup>-1</sup>) for two different internal mixing assumptions, the latter of which is based on previous observations. The higher observed MAC value may be explained by an underestimation of BC, the presence of small amounts of dust and/or possible differences in BC microphysics and morphologies between the observations and model. In comparing the observations and simulations, we present ?ap and SSA, as measured, and ?<sub>ap</sub> 2 and the corresponding SSA to encompass the lower modelled MAC that is more consistent with accepted MAC values. Median values of the measured ?ap, rBC and the organic component of particles all increase by a factor of 1.8±0.1, going from near-surface to 750 hPa, and values higher than the surface persist to 600 hPa. Modelled BC, organics and ?ap agree with the near-surface measurements but do not reproduce the higher values observed between 900 and 600 hPa. The differences between modelled and observed optical properties follow the same trend as the differences between the modelled and observed concentrations of the carbonaceous components (black and organic). Model-observation discrepancies may be mostly due to the modelled ejection of biomass burning particles only into the boundary layer at the sources. For the assumption of the observed MAC value, the SSA range between 0.88 and 0.94, which is significantly lower than other recent estimates for the Arctic, in part reflecting the constraint of ?sp<15 Mm<sup>-1</sup>. The large uncertainties in measuring optical properties and BC, and the large differences between measured and modelled values here and in the literature, argue for improved measurements of BC and light absorption by BC and more vertical profiles of aerosol chemistry, microphysics and other optical properties in the Arctic.  bSC00117804 a54 environmental sciences2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Leiomodin, a member of the tropomodulin family of proteins, is critical in thin filament assembly and maintenance; however, its role is under dispute. Using nuclear magnetic resonance data and molecular dynamics simulations, we generated the first atomic structural model of the binding interface between the tropomyosin-binding site of cardiac leiomodin and the N-terminus of striated muscle tropomyosin. Our structural data indicate that the leiomodin/tropomyosin complex only forms at the pointed end of thin filaments, where the tropomyosin N-terminus is not blocked by an adjacent tropomyosin protomer. This discovery provides evidence supporting the debated mechanism where leiomodin and tropomodulin regulate thin filament lengths by competing for thin filament binding. Data from experiments performed in cardiomyocytes provide additional support for the competition model; specifically, expression of a leiomodin mutant that is unable to interact with tropomyosin fails to displace tropomodulin at thin filament pointed ends and fails to elongate thin filaments. Together with previous structural and biochemical data, we now propose a molecular mechanism of actin polymerization at the pointed end in the presence of bound leiomodin. In the proposed model, the N-terminal actin-binding site of leiomodin can act as a ?swinging gate? allowing limited actin polymerization, thus making leiomodin a leaky pointed-end cap. Results presented in this work answer long-standing questions about the role of leiomodin in thin filament length regulation and maintenance.  bAC05-76RL01830  b GM120137  b HL123078  b T32-GM008336  b 19POST34450023  b T32HL007249  b 1F31AR0762094 a2d-nmr4 aProtein2 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aNational Institutes of Health (U.S.).4spn1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aTolkatchev, Dmitri 4aut1 aSmith, Garry E. 4aut1 aSchultz, Lauren E. 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/167361903134nam a22004213u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124245016500137260019200302300005200494500003900546500001600585500003400601500010800635500005100743520141600794536001902210536001502229536002002244536002002264536002002284650002402304650002502328650001602353650002302369710006002392710009002452720002402542720002102566720002302587720005602610856004602666OST1674974TOE20201021000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20201014|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1674974  aTOEcTOE00aModeling, analysis, and code/data validation of DIII-D tokamak divertor experiments on ELM and non-ELM plasma tungsten sputtering erosionh[electronic resource]  aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

Modeling is done for ELM-ing H-mode, and L-mode plasmas, impinging on various size tungsten deposits on Divertor Material Evaluation System (DiMES) carbon probes. The simulations compute 3-D, full kinetic, sub-gyromotion, impurity sputtering and transport, including changes in tungsten surface composition and response due to mixed deuterium and carbon ions irradiation. Per our analysis, ELM plasma sputtering in DIII-D mostly involves free-streaming high energy (~500-1000 eV) D<sup>+</sup> and C<sup>+6</sup> ions, with high near-surface plasma density. L-Mode sputtering is due to impurity sputtering (C, W) only, with lower density. All cases show complete redeposition of tungsten on the divertor, with significant redeposition on the tungsten spots themselves, and low self-sputtering. Comparison of ELM plasma gross tungsten erosion simulation results with in-situ spectroscopic data is good, as are code/data comparisons of net erosion using post-exposure Rutherford Back Scattering (RBS) data for the L-mode probes. The analysis, extrapolated to a full tungsten divertor, implies low net erosion and negligible plasma contamination from sputtering.

The spacetimes in this fluid-gravity duality are algebraically special, with Petrov type II when the spacetime is four dimensional. We find two special classes of fluids whose dual spacetimes exhibit higher algebraic speciality: constant vorticity flows have type D gravity duals, while potential flows map to type N spacetimes. Using the Weyl version of the classical double copy, we construct associated single-copy gauge fields for both cases, finding that constant vorticity fluids map to a solenoid gauge field. Additionally we find the scalar in a potential flow fluid maps to the zeroth copy scalar.  bSC00194704 aClassical theories of gravity4 aGauge-gravity correspondence4 aScattering amplitudes2 aUnited States.

Here, silicon optical fibers are grown using high pressure chemical vapor deposition before being coated by 50 ?m?300 ?m of diamond by microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. This coating extends conformally around the fiber cross section with diamond crystallites in the film on the order of several micrometers. Complete coating of high-quality diamond around the fiber is indicated by scanning electron microscopy and Raman measurements. The encapsulated silicon fibers are durable enough to survive the diamond deposition process, as demonstrated by their ability to guide infrared light.  bNA0003975  b NA0003858  b SC00010574 aRaman spectroscopy4 aChemical vapor deposition4 aPlasma sources4 aOptical fibers4 aThermal effects4 aScanning electron microscopy4 aChemical elements4 aMaterials synthesis and processing2 aUnited States.

We produced one of the first wireworm genome assemblies (Limonius californicus), and investigated population structure and phylogenetic relationships of three species (L. californicus, L. infuscatus, L. canus) across the northwest US and southwest Canada using genome-wide markers (RADseq) and genome skimming. We found two species (L. californicus and L. infuscatus) are comprised of multiple genetically distinct groups that diverged in the Pleistocene but have no known distinguishing morphological characters, and therefore could be considered cryptic species complexes. We also found within-species population structure across relatively short geographic distances. Genome scans for selection provided preliminary evidence for signatures of adaptation associated with different pesticide treatments in an agricultural field trial for L. canus. We demonstrate that genomic tools can be a strong asset in developing effective wireworm control strategies.  bAC36-08GO283084 a59 basic biological sciences4 aBiogeography4 aMolecular ecology4 aPhylogenetics4 aPopulation genetics2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

The measurements are used to not only retrieve flow velocities, but also their variance and - by using the turbulent broadening of the Doppler spectrum - also turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate. The study shows that turbulence in the WT wake is dependent on the turbulence of the inflow, but also on atmospheric stability. In stable atmospheric conditions, wakes could be analyzed up to five rotor diameters downstream (D) and showed the maximum turbulence in the wake at 2-3 D, whereas in unstable conditions, the maximum was found at 2 D and the wake could not be detected further than 3 D. A clear dependency of wake turbulence enhancement on inflow turbulence intensity is found, which levels out to no further enhancement at turbulence intensities of 30%.  bAC36-08GO283084 a49 ee - wind and water power program - wind (ee-4w)4 aDoppler wind lidars4 aWind direction4 aWind turbine4 aFlow velocities4 aVariance4 aTurbulent kinetic energy2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

D. ; Adkins, Joshua N. ; Konkel, Michael E. .3 aThe symptoms of infectious diarrheal disease are mediated by a combination of a pathogen?s 39 virulence factors and the host immune system. <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> is the leading bacterial 40 cause of diarrhea worldwide due to its near-ubiquitous zoonotic association with poultry. One of 41 the outstanding questions is to what extent the bacteria are responsible for the diarrheal 42 symptoms via intestinal cell necrosis versus immune cell initiated tissue damage. To determine 43 the stepwise process of inflammation that leads to diarrhea, we used a piglet ligated intestinal 44 loop model to study the intestinal response to <em>C. jejuni</em>. Pigs were chosen due to the anatomical 45 similarity between the porcine and the human intestine. We found that the abundance of 46 neutrophil related proteins increased in the intestinal lumen during <em>C. jejuni</em> infection, including 47 proteins related to neutrophil migration (neutrophil elastase and MMP9), actin reorganization 48 (Arp2/3), and antimicrobial proteins (lipocalin-2, myeloperoxidase, S100A8, and S100A9). The 49 appearance of neutrophil proteins also corresponded with increases of the inflammatory 50 cytokines IL-8 and TNF-a. Compared to infection with the <em>C. jejun</em>i wild-type strain, infection with 51 the noninvasive <em>C. jejuni ?ciaD</em> mutant resulted in a blunted inflammatory response, with less 52 inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil markers. Overall, these findings indicate that intestinal 53 inflammation is driven by <em>C. jejuni</em> virulence and that neutrophils are the predominant cell type 54 responding to <em>C. jejuni</em> infection. We propose that this model can be used as a platform to study 55 the early immune events during infection with intestinal pathogens.  bAC05-76RL01830  b R01AI125356  b R21AI124144  b GM094623  b 5T32AI007025  b R01AI0833874 aDisease model4 aInnate immunity4 aProteomics4 aIntestinal disease4 aPathogenesis2 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aNational Institutes of Health (U.S.).4spn1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aNegretti, Nicholas M. 4aut1 aYe, Yinyin 4aut1 aMalavasi, Lais M. 4aut40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/167103602800nam a22004213u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124245011300137260019200250300005000442500003900492500001600531500003400547500009500581500005100676520108200727536001401809650004301823650002701866650003601893650001901929650001501948650002001963650001801983650002602001710006002027710009002087720004002177720003402217720002502251720005602276856004602332OST1670425TOE20201009000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200925|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1670425  aTOEcTOE03aAn Optimal Power Control Strategy for Grid-Following Inverters in a Synchronous Frameh[electronic resource]  aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

The use of an LQR-ORT controller increases robustness margins and reduces the quadratic value of the power error and control inputs during transient response. A model in a synchronous reference frame that integrates power sharing and voltage?current (V?I) dynamics is also proposed. This model allows for analyzing closed-loop eigenvalue location and robustness margins. The proposed controller was compared against a classical droop approach using proportional-resonant controllers for the inner loops. Mathematical analysis and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments under variations in the LCL filter components demonstrate fulfillment of robustness and performance bounds of the LQR-ORT controller. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the LQR-ORT controller in improving transient response, robustness, and power decoupling.  bSC00202814 a24 power transmission and distribution4 aGrid-following control4 aHardware-in-the-loop experiment4 aLqr controller4 aMicrogrids4 aOptimal control4 aPower control4 aThree-phase inverters2 aUnited States.

Spaceborne remote sensing techniques provide a unique means for mapping accurate spatiotemporally continuous SW?PAR, globally. However, any individual polar-orbiting or geostationary satellite cannot satisfy the desired high temporal resolution (sub-daily) and global coverage simultaneously, while integrating and fusing multisource data from complementary satellites/sensors is challenging because of co-registration, intercalibration, near real-time data delivery and the effects of discrepancies in orbital geometry. The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on board the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), launched in February 2015, offers an unprecedented possibility to bridge the gap between high temporal resolution and global coverage and characterize the diurnal cycles of SW?PAR globally. In this study, we adopted a suite of well-validated data-driven machine-learning models to generate the first global land products of SW?PAR, from June 2015 to June 2019, based on DSCOVR/EPIC data. The derived products have high temporal resolution (hourly) and medium spatial resolution (0.1°×0.1°), and they include estimates of the direct and diffuse components of SW?PAR. We used independently widely distributed ground station data from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD), NOAA's Global Monitoring Division and the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric System Research (ASR) program to evaluate the performance of our products, and we further analyzed and compared the spatiotemporal characteristics of the derived products with the benchmarking Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Synoptic (CERES) data. We found both the hourly and daily products to be consistent with ground-based observations (e.g., hourly and daily total SWs have low biases of -3.96 and -0.71 W m<sup>-2</sup> and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 103.50 and 35.40 W m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively). The developed products capture the complex spatiotemporal patterns well and accurately track substantial diurnal, monthly, and seasonal variations in SW?PAR when compared to CERES data. They provide a reliable and valuable alternative for solar photovoltaic applications worldwide and can be used to improve our understanding of the diurnal and seasonal variabilities of the terrestrial water, carbon and energy fluxes at various spatial scales.  bAC05-76RL018304 a54 environmental sciences2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Although root traits capture key dimensions related to plant responses to changing environmental conditions and effects on ecosystem processes, they have rarely been included in large-scale comparative studies and global models. For instance, root traits remain absent from nearly all studies that define the global spectrum of plant form and function. Thus, to overcome conceptual and methodological roadblocks preventing a widespread integration of root trait data into large-scale analyses we created the Global Root Trait (GRooT) Database. GRooT provides readyto- use data by combining the expertise of root ecologists with data mobilization and curation. Specifically, we (a) determined a set of core root traits relevant to the description of plant form and function based on an assessment by experts, (b) maximized species coverage through data standardization within and among traits, and (c) implemented data quality checks. Main types of variables contained: GRooT contains 114,222 trait records on 38 continuous root traits. Spatial location and grain: Global coverage with data from arid, continental, polar, temperate and tropical biomes. Data on root traits were derived from experimental studies and field studies. Time period and grain: Data were recorded between 1911 and 2019. Major taxa and level of measurement: GRooT includes root trait data for which taxonomic information is available. Trait records vary in their taxonomic resolution, with subspecies or varieties being the highest and genera the lowest taxonomic resolution available. It contains information for 184 subspecies or varieties, 6,214 species, 1,967 genera and 254 families. Owing to variation in data sources, trait records in the database include both individual observations and mean values. Software format: GRooT includes two csv files. A GitHub repository contains the csv files and a script in R to query the database.  bAC05-00OR22725  b DFG FZT 118  b RU-1815/20-1  b RI 1815/22-1  b 016.161.318  b 16-14-102084 aBelowground ecology4 aFunctional biogeography4 aMacroecological studies4 aPlant form and function4 aPublicly-available database4 aRoot traits2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Two major corn and soybean croplands were selected for study: the South Fork of the Iowa River watershed and the headwater of the Raccoon River watershed. A physically based model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, was used to simulate hydrology and water quality under different scenarios with conservation practices and biomass production. Scenarios are based on conservation practices and biomass production; riparian buffer (RB), saturated buffer, and grassed waterways; various stover harvest rates of 30%, 45%, and 70% with and without winter cover crops; and conversion of marginal land to switchgrass. Conservation practices and landscape design with different biomass feedstocks were shown to significantly improve water quality while supporting sustainable biomass production. Model results for nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended sediments were analyzed temporally at spatial scales that varied from hydrologic response units to the entire watershed. With conservation practices, water quality could potentially improve by reducing nitrogen loads by up to 20%?30% (stover harvest with cover crop), phosphorus loads by 20%?40% (RB), and sediment loads by 30%?70% (stover harvest with cover crop and RB).  bAC05-00OR22725  b AC02-06CH11357  b 17617724 aConservation practices4 aBioenergy4 aSwat4 aHydrologic modeling4 aWater quality4 aNutrients2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

The catalog contains 4845 sources measured at a significance of 4.5 sigma or greater in at least one band, corresponding to detections above approximately 9.8, 5.8, and 20.4 mJy in 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. Spectral behavior in the SPT bands is used for source classification into two populations based on the underlying physical mechanisms of compact, emissive sources that are bright at millimeter wavelengths: synchrotron radiation from active galactic nuclei and thermal emission from dust. The latter population includes a component of high-redshift sources often referred to as submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). In the relatively bright flux ranges probed by the survey, these sources are expected to be magnified by strong gravitational lensing. The survey also contains sources consistent with protoclusters, groups of dusty galaxies at high redshift undergoing collapse. We cross-match the SPT-SZ catalog with external catalogs at radio, infrared, and X-ray wavelengths and identify available redshift information. The catalog splits into 3980 synchrotron-dominated and 865 dust-dominated sources and we determine a list of 506 SMGs. Ten sources in the catalog are identified as stars. We calculate number counts for the full catalog, and synchrotron and dusty components, using a bootstrap method and compare our measured counts with models. This paper represents the third and final catalog of point sources in the SPT-SZ survey.  bAC02-07CH113594 a79 astronomy and astrophysics4 a46 instrumentation related to nuclear science and technology2 aArgonne National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Time-resolved electron emission from nano-sized sources finds applications ranging from material characterisation to fundamental studies of quantum coherence. We present a nano-sized electron source capable of fast-switching (?1 ns) that can be driven with low-power femtosecond lasers. The physical mechanism that can explain emission at low laser power is surface plasmon enhanced above-threshold photoemission. An electron emission peak is observed and provides support for resonant plasmonic excitation. The electron source is a metal-coated optical fibre tapered into a nano-sized tip. The fibre is flexible and back illuminated facilitating ease of positioning. The source operates with a few nJ per laser pulse, making this a versatile emitter that enables nanometrology, multisource electron-lithography and scanning probe microscopy.  bAC05-00OR22725  b EPS-1430519 and PHY-1912504.4 aFibre optic nanotip4 aSurface plasmon resonance4 aMulti-photon emission4 aAbove-threshold emission2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aNational Science Foundation (U.S.).4spn1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aKeramati, Sam 4aut1 aPassian, Ali 4aut1 aKhullar, Vineet 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/165134202807nam a22004453u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124086002700137088002000164245015600184260019800340300005200538500003900590500001600629500002300645500003400668500002100702500003900723520110600762536001901868536001501887650001001902650001801912650003301930650003401963650002101997650002502018650002502043710004002068710006602108710009002174720002402264720002702288856004602315OST1667423TOE20201009000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200911|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1667423  aTOEcTOE0 aE 1.99:sand-2020-9141j  asand-2020-9141j00aRevisiting the Effects of Xenon on Urate Oxidase and Tissue Plasminogen Activatorh[electronic resource] :b No Evidence for Inhibition by Noble Gases   aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

For example, Xe is a powerful anesthetic with neuroprotective properties. Recent reports have claimed that Xe inhibits the activity of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urate oxidase (UOX), indicating that the use of Xe as an anesthetic may have undesirable side effects. Here, we revisited the methods used to demonstrate Xe inhibition of UOX and tPA, testing both indirect and direct gas delivery methods with variable bubble sizes and gas flowrates. Our results indicate that Xe or Kr do not affect the activity of UOX or tPA and that the previously reported inhibition is due to protein damage attendant to directly bubbling gases into protein solutions. The lack of evidence to support Xe inhibition of UOX or tPA alleviates concerns regarding possible side effects for the clinical application of Xe as an anesthetic. Furthermore, this study illustrates the importance of using indirect methods of gas dissolution for studying gas-protein interactions in aqueous solution.  bAC04-94AL85000  b NA00035254 aXenon4 aUrate oxidase4 aTissue plasminogen activator4 aNoble gas-protein interaction4 aProtein sparging4 aProtein denaturation4 aLiquid-gas interface2 aSandia National Laboratories..4res2 aUnited States.

On this day, ShCu forms over Oklahoma and southern Kansas and some of these clouds transition to deeper, precipitating convection during the afternoon. We apply a four-dimensional ensemble-variational (4DEnVar) hybrid technique in the Community Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system to assimilate operational data sets and unique boundary layer measurements including a Raman lidar, radar wind profilers, radiosondes, and surface stations collected by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) atmospheric observatory into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to ascertain how improved environmental conditions can influence forecasts of ShCu populations and the transition to deeper convection. Independent observations from aircraft, satellite, as well as ARM's remote sensors are used to evaluate model performance in different aspects. Several model experiments are conducted to identify the impact of data assimilation (DA) on the prediction of clouds evolution. The analyses indicate that ShCu populations are more accurately reproduced after DA in terms of cloud initiation time and cloud base height, which can be attributed to an improved representation of the ambient meteorological conditions and the convective boundary layer. Extending the assimilation to 18 UTC (local noon) also improved the simulation of shallow-to-deep transitions of convective clouds.  bAC05-76RL018304 a54 environmental sciences2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

While Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> has been widely studied as methanol oxidation catalyst, the initial process of oxidizing Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> to NiOOH requires a high potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE. Such potential would be impractical since the theoretical potential of the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction is at 1.23 V. Here we show that a four-coordinated nickel atom is able to form charge-transfer orbitals through delocalization of electrons near the Fermi energy level. As such, our previously reported periodically arranged four-six-coordinated nickel hydroxide nanoribbon structure (NR-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>) is able to show remarkable methanol oxidation activity with an onset potential of 0.55 V vs. RHE and suggests the operability in direct methanol fuel cell configuration. Thus, this strategy offers a gateway towards the development of high performance and durable non-platinum direct methanol fuel cell.  bSC00127044 a36 materials science2 aUnited States.

However, appropriate selection of cells for different applications is difficult due to limited public data comparing the most commonly used off-the-shelf Li-ion chemistries under the same operating conditions. This article details a multi-year cycling study of commercial LiFePO<SUB>4</SUB> (LFP), LiNi<SUB>x</SUB>Co<SUB>y</SUB>Al<SUB>1?x?y</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> (NCA), and LiNi<SUB>x</SUB>Mn<SUB>y</SUB>Co<SUB>1?x?y</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> (NMC) cells, varying the discharge rate, depth of discharge (DOD), and environment temperature. The capacity and discharge energy retention, as well as the round-trip efficiency, were compared. Even when operated within manufacturer specifications, the range of cycling conditions had a profound effect on cell degradation, with time to reach 80% capacity varying by thousands of hours and cycle counts among cells of each chemistry.

Our combined electrical resistance, Raman, and synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments show that the insulating ground state in this osmate endures under high pressure up to at least 35 GPa. In this pressure range, compression reveals hidden hysteretic resistance properties with a transient metallic state near 200 K, manifested three electronic character anomalies (at 1.7, 9.0, and 25.5 GPa), and a structural transition to the singular polar phase (at ~18 GPa). We distinguish NaOsO<sub>3</sub> from the regular crystallographic behavior of perovskites, though the electrical specificities resemble iridates and nickelates. The theoretical first-principle band structure and lattice dynamics calculations demonstrate that the magnetically itinerant Lifshitz-type mechanism with spin?orbit and spin?phonon interactions is responsible for these pressure-induced changes. Our findings provide another new playground for the emergence of new states in 5d materials by using high-pressure methods.  bAC02-06CH113572 aArgonne National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

The overall approach is similar in spirit to the one retained for the 2013 and 2015 data release, with a hybrid method using different approximations at low (<em>?</em> < 30) and high (<em>?</em> ? 30) multipoles, implementing several methodological and data-analysis refinements compared to previous releases. With more realistic simulations, and better correction and modelling of systematic effects, we can now make full use of the CMB polarization observed in the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) channels. The low-multipole <rm>EE</em> cross-spectra from the 100 GHz and 143 GHz data give a constraint on the ?CDM reionization optical-depth parameter <em>?</em> to better than 15% (in combination with the <em>TT</em> low-<em>?</em> data and the high-<em>?</em> temperature and polarization data), tightening constraints on all parameters with posterior distributions correlated with <em>?</em>. We also update the weaker constraint on <em>?</em> from the joint TEB likelihood using the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) channels, which was used in 2015 as part of our baseline analysis. At higher multipoles, the CMB temperature spectrum and likelihood are very similar to previous releases. A better model of the temperature-to-polarization leakage and corrections for the effective calibrations of the polarization channels (i.e., the polarization efficiencies) allow us to make full use of polarization spectra, improving the ?CDM constraints on the parameters <em>?</em><sub>MC</sub>, <em>?</em><sub>c</sub>, <em>?</em><sub>b</sub>, and <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> by more than 30%, and n<sub>s</sub> by more than 20% compared to TT-only constraints. Extensive tests on the robustness of the modelling of the polarization data demonstrate good consistency, with some residual modelling uncertainties. At high multipoles, we are now limited mainly by the accuracy of the polarization efficiency modelling. Using our various tests, simulations, and comparison between different high-multipole likelihood implementations, we estimate the consistency of the results to be better than the 0.5 <em>?</em> level on the ?CDM parameters, as well as classical single-parameter extensions for the joint likelihood (to be compared to the 0.3 <em>?</em> levels we achieved in 2015 for the temperature data alone on ?CDM only). Minor curiosities already present in the previous releases remain, such as the differences between the best-fit ?CDM parameters for the <em>?</em> < 800 and <em>?</em> > 800 ranges of the power spectrum, or the preference for more smoothing of the power-spectrum peaks than predicted in ?CDM fits. These are shown to be driven by the temperature power spectrum and are not significantly modified by the inclusion of the polarization data. Overall, the legacy <em>Planck</em> CMB likelihoods provide a robust tool for constraining the cosmological model and represent a reference for future CMB observations.  bAC02-05CH112314 aCosmic background radiation4 aCosmology: observations4 aCosmological parameters4 aMethods: data analysis2 aLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Recent studies have shown that several factors including diet, lifestyle and geography may substantially shape the human gut microbiota. However, most of these studies have focused on the more abundant bacterial component and comparatively less is known regarding fungi in the human gut. This knowledge deficit is especially true for rural and urban African populations. Therefore, we assessed the structure and drivers of rural and urban gut mycobiota. Results Our participants (n=100) were balanced by geography and sex. The mycobiota of these geographically separated cohorts was characterized using amplicon analysis of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) gene. We further assessed biomarker species specific to rural and urban cohorts. In addition to phyla which have been shown to be ubiquitous constituents of gut microbiota, Pichia were key constituents of the mycobiota. We found that several factors including geographic location and lifestyle factors such as the smoking status were major drivers of gut mycobiota. Linear discriminant and the linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis revealed several distinct urban and rural biomarkers. Conclusions Together, our analysis reveals distinct community structure in urban and rural South African individuals. Geography and lifestyle related factors were shown to be key drivers of rural and urban gut microbiota.  bAC05-76RL018304 aGut microbiome, ethnicity, mycobiota, diet, africa, rural, urban2 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aKabwe, Mubanga Hellen 4aut1 aVikram, Surendra 4aut1 aMulaudzi, Khodani 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/166832403506nam a22005413u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124086002600137088001900163245011500182260019200297300005000489500003900539500001600578500002200594500003400616500010800650520153700758536001902295536001402314536001402328536002002342536001202362536002202374536002202396536002202418536001702440650003602457650002002493650001502513650003402528650001502562650002102577650002302598650002002621710005502641710006002696710009002756720002202846720002602868720002402894856004602918OST1673578TOE20201019000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200826|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1673578  aTOEcTOE0 aE 1.99:pnnl-sa-151977  apnnl-sa-15197700aFic Proteins Inhibit the Activity of Topoisomerase IV by AMPylation in Diverse Bacteriah[electronic resource]  aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

Some Fic proteins, including Fic-1 from the soil bacterium <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> strain 2P24, have been shown to inhibit bacterial DNA replication by AMPylating the subunit B of DNA gyrase (GyrB), but the biochemical activity and cellular target of most Fic proteins remain unknown. Here, we report that Fic-2, which is another Fic protein from strain 2P24 and Fic-1 AMPylate the topoisomerase IV ParE at Tyr<sup>109</sup>. We also examined Fic proteins from several phylogenetically diverse bacteria and found that those from <em>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> AMPylate ParE and GrlB, the counterpart of ParE in Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Modification by Fic-1 of <em>P. fluorescens</em> and FicY of <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> inhibits the relaxation activity of topoisomerase IV. Consistent with the inhibition of ParE activity, ectopic expression of these Fic proteins causes cell filamentation akin to the canonical <em>par</em> phenotype in which nucleoids are assembled in the center of elongated cells, a process accompanied by the induction of the SOS response. Our results establish that Fic proteins from diverse bacterial species regulate chromosome division and cell separation in bacteria by targeting ParE.  bAC05-76RL01830  b 31872020  b 31572045  b 2017YFD0201106  b B13006  b 2018530000241006  b 2019530000241007  b 2020530000241013  b R01AI1274654 aPost-translational modification4 aToxin-antitoxin4 aAmpylation4 aFilamentation induced by camp4 aDna gyrase4 aTopoisomerase iv4 aCell filamentation4 aDna replication2 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

We uncover a spectacular, extreme softening and reconstruction of an entire manifold of low-energy acoustic and optic branches across a structural transition, reflecting strong directionality in bonding strength and anharmonicity. Further, our results solve a prior controversy by revealing the soft-mode mechanism of the phase transition that impacts thermal transport and thermoelectric efficiency. Our simulations of anharmonic phonon renormalization go beyond low-order perturbation theory and capture these striking effects, showing that the large phonon shifts directly affect the thermal conductivity by altering both the phonon scattering phase space and the group velocities. These results provide a detailed microscopic understanding of phase stability and thermal transport in technologically important materials, providing further insights on ways to control phonon propagation in thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and other materials requiring thermal management.  bAC05-00OR22725  b SC0019299  b SC0016166  b AC02-05CH112314 aPhase transitions and critical phenomena4 aThermoelectrics4 aThermoelectrics, lattice dynamics, phonons, anharmonicity, thermal transport, phase transitions2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

We develop an offline analysis that tightly estimates the number of floating-point bits preserved across stencil applications. This estimate rigorously bounds the values expected in the data space of the computation. Violations of this bound can be attributed with certainty to errors. FPDetect helps synthesize error detectors customized for user-specified levels of accuracy and coverage. FPDetect also enables overhead reduction techniques based on deploying these detectors coarsely in space and time. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the practicality of our approach.  bAC05-76RL01830  b 66905  b 1704715  b 1817073  b 19184974 aFault tolerance4 aStencil programs4 aSoft-error detection4 aFloating-point analysis4 aError detection and error correction4 aComputer systems organization4 aReliability4 aSoftware and its engineering4 aSoftware verification4 aMathematics of computing4 aNumerical analysis4 aFloating point round-off error4 aStencil computations4 aAffine analysis4 aInterval analysis4 aSilent data corruption4 aSoftware bug detection2 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

Regulatory networks respond to environmental and genetic perturbations by reprogramming cellular metabolism. Here we design, construct, and map a comprehensive regulatory network library containing 110,120 specific mutations in 82 regulators expected to perturb metabolism. We screen the library for different targeted phenotypes, and identify mutants that confer strong resistance to various inhibitors, and/or enhanced production of target compounds. These improvements are identified in a single round of selection, showing that the regulatory network library is universally applicable and is convenient and effective for engineering targeted phenotypes. The facile construction and mapping of the regulatory network library provides a path for developing a more detailed understanding of global regulation in <em>E. coli</em>, with potential for adaptation and use in less-understood organisms, expanding toolkits for future strain engineering, synthetic biology, and broader efforts.  bAC36-08GO28308  b SC00183684 aRegulatory networks4 aCrispr4 aLarge scale saturation4 aMutagenesis library4 aIsobutanol4 aIsopropanol2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

To determine how the cellular transcriptome and proteome changes during these transitions, we developed a new cell sorting method to purify stem cells, secretory and absorptive progenitor cells, and mature, differentiated cells. Transcriptome analyses revealed that as stem cells transition to the progenitor stage, alternative mRNA splicing and polyadenylation dominate changes in the transcriptome. In contrast, as progenitors differentiate into mature cell types, alterations in gene expression and mRNA levels drive the changes. RNA processing targets mRNAs encoding regulators of cell cycle, RNA regulators, cell adhesion, SUMOylation, and Wnt and Notch signaling. Additionally, global proteome profiling of sorted cell populations detected >2,800 proteins and revealed RNA:protein patterns of abundance and correlation. Paired together, these data highlight new potentials for autocrine and feedback regulation and provide new insights into cell state transitions in the crypt.  bAC05-76RL01830  b T32CA009054  b R01CA177651  b R01GM090056  b R01CA244571  b P30CA062203  b U54CA217378  b 1U01CA227544  b R21CA223715  b DGE?13218464 aColon, flow cytometry, intestinal stem cells, proteomics, transcriptomics2 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

In pathological states such as cancer, EV-derived cargo may mirror the altered state of the cell of origin. Exosomes are the smaller, 50?150 nanometer-sized EVs released from fusion of multivesicular endosomes with the plasma membrane. Exosomes play important roles in cell-cell communication and participate in multiple cancer processes, including invasion and metastasis. Therefore, proteomic analysis of exosomes is a promising approach to discover potential cancer biomarkers, even though it is still at an early stage. Herein, we critically review the advances in exosome isolation methods and their compatibility with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analysis, as well as studies of exosomes in pathogenesis and progression of prostate and bladder cancer, two common urologic cancers whose incidence rates continue to rise annually. As urological tumors, both urine and blood samples are feasible for noninvasive or minimally invasive analysis. A better understanding of the biological cargo and functions of exosomes via high-throughput proteomics will help provide new insights into complex alterations in cancer and provide potential therapeutic targets and personalized treatment for patients.  bAC05-76RL01830  b U24CA210955  b U01CA214116  b R21CA223715  b P41GM1034934 aExosome, proteomics, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, exosome isolation method2 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

The local consumption of PV generation provides several advantages to the grid operation as well as the consumers, such as reducing the stress on the distribution network, minimizing voltage fluctuations and two-way power flows in the distribution network, and reducing the required battery storage capacity for PV integration. This would result in increasing the solar PV generation penetration levels. The aims of this study are twofold. First, spectral (frequency) analyses of solar PV power generation together with the power consumption of multiple building TCLs (such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, water heaters, and refrigerators) are performed. These analyses define the bandwidth over which these TCLs can operate and also describe the PV generation frequency bandwidth. Such spectral analyses, in frequency domain, can help identify the flexible components of PV generation that can be consumed by the various TCLs through optimal building load utilization. Second, a quadratic optimization problem based on model predictive control is formulated to allow consuming most of the low and medium frequency content of the PV power locally by building TCLs, while maintaining occupants? comfort and TCLs? physical constraints. The solution to the proposed optimization problem is achieved using optimal control strategies. Numerical results show that most of the low and medium frequency content of the PV generation can be consumed locally by building TCLs.

Tool capabilities were extended to facilitate multiple aerodynamic polar tables. The airfoil aerodynamics characteristics were automatically determined, and blade-pitch, generator-torque, and trailing-edge-flap controllers were tuned in-the-loop according to a specific blade design. This automated workflow allows analysis and optimization of trailing-edge flaps, enabling codesign studies. Results targeted reductions of root-flap-bending moment derivatives. The applied trailing-edge-flap control reduced the standard deviation of root-flap-bending moments by more than 6% and benefit related parameters, e.g., reduce blade-tip deflections, by up to 8%. Because of varying thrust distributions along the blade span, different flap designs have nonlinear characteristics in terms of the control objective and show best performance when located at the radial position with maximum thrust. In general, larger flaps provide a greater influence to reduce the target control objective.  bAC36-08GO283084 a49 ee - wind and water power program - wind (ee-4w)4 aDistributed aerodynamic control4 aActive trailing-edge flaps4 aMdao4 aLarge rotors2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

Instantaneous near-wake expansion and deflection in response to changes in blade pitch and wind direction, termed dynamic wake modulation, is quantified using both techniques, demonstrating excellent agreement. The simulations are used to extend these results by calculating the energy flux into the wake 7 rotor diameters downstream, showing that dynamic turbine-atmospheric interactions enhance mixing in the far-wake. This finding is exhibited under both uniform and turbulent inflow conditions. Under turbulent flow, a synergistic relationship is also observed between dynamic wake modulation and wake meandering, as wake recovery can be further accelerated when the two phenomena occur together. The results of this study have implications for the development of more realistic far-wake models that include the significant impact of dynamic wake modulation on wake mixing and development. Additionally, the findings from the current study can be used to develop advanced control algorithms to speed up wake breakdown and recovery, further improving wind farm efficiency.  bAC36-08GO283084 aFlow visualization4 aLarge-eddy simulations4 aDynamic turbine operation4 aAtmospheric conditions4 aWake mixing4 aWind turbines2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

Rate of depletion of the Al-rich ?-phase in the bond coat governs the lifetime of these coatings. The applicability of a computational method in accelerating the development of corrosion resistant coatings and significantly reducing the extensive experimental effort to predict coating lifetimes and microstructural changes in three-coated Ni-based superalloys for real operational durations (20?40 kh) was undertaken in the present study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) were employed to characterize MCrAlY-coated superalloy substrates (1483, 247 and X4) after exposure at 900 °C in air + 10% H<sub>2</sub>O for up to 20,000 h. The model predicted the longest coating lifetime for the coating on X4 substrate. Precipitation of ?' in the coatings was correctly predicted for all three coating systems. Additionally, the model was able to predict the formation of topologically close packed (TCP)-phases in the investigated coating systems.  bAC05-00OR227252 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

The serrated flow that occurs in high-entropy alloys during mechanical deformation is an important phenomenon since it can lead to significant changes in the microstructure of the alloy. In this article, we review the recent findings on the serration behavior in a variety of high-entropy alloys. Relationships among the serrated flow behavior, composition, microstructure, and testing condition are explored. Importantly, the mechanical-testing type (compression/tension), testing temperature, applied strain rate, and serration type for certain high-entropy alloys are summarized. The literature reveals that the serrated flow can be affected by experimental conditions such as the strain rate and test temperature. Furthermore, this type of phenomenon has been successfully modeled and analyzed, using several different types of analytical methods, including the mean-field theory formalism and the complexity-analysis technique. Importantly, the results of the analyses show that the serrated flow in HEAs consists of complex dynamical behavior. It is anticipated that this review will provide some useful and clarifying information regarding the serrated-flow mechanisms in this material system. Finally, suggestions for future research directions in this field are proposed, such as the effects of irradiation, additives (such as C and Al), the presence of nanoparticles, and twinning on the serrated flow behavior in HEAs.  bAC05-00OR227254 a36 materials science2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aBrechtl, Jamieson 4aut1 aChen, Shuying 4aut1 aLee, Chanho 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/164887002789nam a22004093u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124245015400137260017200291300004900463500003900512500001600551500003400567500011100601500001100712520119100723536001901914536001801933650001201951650002101963650002301984650001602007650002802023710004002051710004502091710009002136720002302226720002302249720004602272720001502318856004602333OST1669747TOE20201012000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200905|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1669747  aTOEcTOE00aAssessing the Reliability of Relevant Tweets and Validation Using Manual and Automatic Approaches for Flood Risk Communicationh[electronic resource]  aOak Ridge, Tenn. :bOak Ridge National Laboratory ;aOak Ridge, Tenn. :bDistributed by the Office of Scientific and Technical Information, U.S. Dept. of Energy,c2020  a Size: Article No. 532 :bdigital, PDF file.  aPublished through Scitech Connect.  a09/05/2020.  a"Journal ID: ISSN 2220-9964."  aLiu, Xiaohui ; Kar, Bandana ; Montiel Ishino, Francisco Alejandro ; Zhang, Chaoyang ; Williams, Faustine .  aUSDOE.3 aWhile Twitter has been touted as a preeminent source of up-to-date information on hazard events, the reliability of tweets is still a concern. Our previous publication extracted relevant tweets containing information about the 2013 Colorado flood event and its impacts. Using the relevant tweets, this research further examined the reliability (accuracy and trueness) of the tweets by examining the text and image content and comparing them to other publicly available data sources. Both manual identification of text information and automated (Google Cloud Vision, application programming interface (API)) extraction of images were implemented to balance accurate information verification and efficient processing time. The results showed that both the text and images contained useful information about damaged/flooded roads/streets. This information will help emergency response coordination efforts and informed allocation of resources when enough tweets contain geocoordinates or location/venue names. This research will identify reliable crowdsourced risk information to facilitate near real-time emergency response through better use of crowdsourced risk communication platforms.  bAC05-00OR22725  b CMMI-13351874 aTwitter4 aData reliability4 aRisk communication4 aData mining4 aGoogle cloud vision api2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aNational Science Foundation (U.S.).4spn1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aLiu, Xiaohui 4aut1 aKar, Bandana 4aut1 aMontiel Ishino, Francisco Alejandro 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/166974703000nam a22004333u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124086003000137088002300167245012300190260022300313300005200536500003900588500001600627500002600643500003400669500002600703500004900729500002500778500003500803520125500838536001902093650005602112650002102168650001602189650001502205650001802220710005402238710009102292710009002383720002502473720002202498856004602520OST1665798TOE20201008000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200922|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1665798  aTOEcTOE0 aE 1.99:nrel/ja-5000-76234  anrel/ja-5000-7623400aHow accurate is a machine learning-based wind speed extrapolation under a round-robin approach?h[electronic resource]  aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

Recently, machine learning has been proposed and applied to extrapolate wind speed to hub heights. However, previous studies trained and tested the machine learning methods at the same site, giving them an unfair advantage over the conventional extrapolation techniques, which are instead more universal. Here, we use data from four sites in Oklahoma to test a round-robin validation approach for machine learning, under which we train a random forest at a site, and test it at a different site, where the model has no prior knowledge of the wind resource. We quantify how the accuracy of this technique varies with distance from the training site, and we find that it outperforms conventional techniques for wind extrapolation at all the considered spatial separations. We then assess how the accuracy of the machine-learning based approach varies when it is used to predict wind speed in a wind farm far wake. Finally, we explore as case study the performance of the random forest in extrapolating winds during a low-level jet event.  bAC36-08GO283084 a49 ee - wind and water power program - wind (ee-4w)4 aMachine learning4 aWind energy4 aWind speed4 aExtrapolation2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

The conserved glycoproteins, gB, gH and gL, are the core functional proteins of the herpesvirus fusion complex. gB serves as the primary fusogen via its fusion loops, but functions for the remaining gB domains remain unexplained. As a pathway for biological discovery of domain function, our approach used structure-based analysis of the viral fusogen together with a neutralizing antibody. We report here a 2.8&#8201;&#197; cryogenic-electron microscopy structure of native gB recovered from VZV-infected cells, in complex with a human monoclonal antibody, 93k. This high-resolution structure guided targeted mutagenesis at the gB-93k interface, providing compelling evidence that a domain spatially distant from the gB fusion loops is critical for herpesvirus fusion, revealing a potential new target for antiviral therapies. Herpesvirus virions have an outer lipid membrane dotted with glycoproteins that enable fusion with cell membranes to initiate entry and establish infection. Here the authors elucidate the structural mechanism of a neutralizing antibody derived from a patient infected by the herpesvirus varicella-zoster virus and targeted to its fusogen, glycoprotein-B.  bP41-GM103832  b R01-AI102546  b R01-GM079429  b R37-AI20459  b S10-OD0216002 aUnited States.

Because of their dominance in data, the measurements of such events are crucial for advancing the precision frontier of Higgs and electroweak physics in the next decades. We show that this difficulty can be well-addressed by synergizing the event-level information into the data analysis, with the techniques of deep neutral network. In relation to this, we introduce a CMB-like observable scheme, where the event-level kinematics is encoded as Fox-Wolfram (FW) moments at leading order and multi-spectra of spherical harmonics at higher orders. Then we develop a series of jet-level (w/ and w/o the FW moments) and event-level classifiers, and analyze their sensitivity performance comparatively with two-jet and four-jet events. As an application, we analyze measuring Higgs decay width at $e^?e^+$ colliders with the data of 5ab<sup>?1</sup>@240GeV. The precision obtained is significantly better than the baseline ones presented in documents. We expect this strategy to be applied to many other hadronic- event measurements at future $e^?e^+$ colliders, and to open a new angle for evaluating their physics capability.  bAC02-07CH11359  b 16302117  b AoE/P-404/18-34 a72 physics of elementary particles and fields4 aJets2 aFermi National Accelerator Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

However, more exploration is needed on understanding the adaptability challenges that the DRL agent could face during the deployment phase. Using online learning for such applications is not realistic due to the long learning period and likely poor comfort control during the learning process. Alternatively, DRL can be pre-trained using a building model prior to deployment. However, developing an accurate building model for every house and deploying a pre-trained DRL model for HVAC control would not be cost-effective. In this study, we focus on evaluating the ability of DRL-based HVAC control to provide cost savings when pre-trained on one building model and deployed on different house models with varying user comforts. We observed around 30% of cost reduction by pre-trained model over baseline when validated in a simulation environment and achieved up to 21% cost reduction when deployed in the real house. This finding provides experimental evidence that the pre-trained DRL has the potential to adapt to different house environments and comfort settings.  bAC05-00OR227254 aBuilding energy4 aDemand response4 aSmart grid4 aOptimal hvac control4 aDeep reinforcement learning4 aAdaptability4 aBuilding simulation2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

In this study, a machine-learning framework is presented to optimize this layer. We featurize 21 organic halide salts, apply them as capping layers onto methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) films, age them under accelerated conditions, and determine features governing stability using supervised machine learning and Shapley values. We find that organic molecules? low number of hydrogen-bonding donors and small topological polar surface area correlate with increased MAPbI<sub>3</sub> film stability. The top performing organic halide, phenyltriethylammonium iodide (PTEAI), successfully extends the MAPbI3 stability lifetime by 4 ± 2 times over bare MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and 1.3 ± 0.3 times over state-of-the-art octylammonium bromide (OABr). Through characterization, we find that this capping layer stabilizes the photoactive layer by changing the surface chemistry and suppressing methylammonium loss.  bSC0012704  b 1541959  b DMR-1419807  b CBET-1605547  b 1913/R  b EE0007535  b W911NF-13-D-0001  b NNX16AM70H4 a36 materials science2 aBrookhaven National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Furthermore, incorporating dielectric granules in the air gap stimulates gas ionization, which lowers the breakdown voltage and narrows breakdown voltage distribution, thereby enabling engineered surge protection from multiple lightning strikes on aerospace vehicles and sensitive solid-state electronics in critical systems. This study investigates the effect of the permittivity of dielectric granules, gap filling, surface roughness, and metal work function on fast-rising, high-voltage breakdowns. In addition to the air gap width, these factors play important roles in gas ionization, field concentration, and initiation of electrical discharge and arcing. Therefore, they could potentially be used to control and narrow operational breakdown voltages for practical applications. Additionally, a modified Langevin?Debye model is developed to correlate the breakdown voltage and the permittivity of the dielectric filler.

The predominant hypothesis that micro-damage accumulation exceeds the rate of biological repair is missing a mechanistic explanation. Here, we used collagen hybridizing peptides to measure collagen molecular damage during tendon cyclic fatigue loading and computational simulations to identify potential explanations for our findings. Our results revealed that triple-helical collagen denaturation accumulates with increasing cycles of fatigue loading, and damage is correlated with creep strain independent of the cyclic strain rate. Finite-element simulations demonstrated that biphasic fluid flow is a possible fascicle-level mechanism to explain the rate dependence of the number of cycles and time to failure. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that triple-helical unfolding is rate dependent, revealing rate-dependent mechanisms at multiple length scales in the tissue. The accumulation of collagen molecular denaturation during cyclic loading provides a long-sought ?micro-damage? mechanism for the development of overuse injuries.4 aCollagen4 aDamage4 aDenaturation4 aFailure4 aFatigue2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aNational Institutes of Health (U.S.).4spn1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aZitnay, Jared L. 4aut1 aJung, Gang Seob 4aut1 aLin, Allen H. 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/165960603708nam a22005653u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124245015000137260019200287300005100479500003900530500001600569500003400585500002500619500028700644500004900931520142900980536001402409536001502423536001602438536002002454536001502474536001502489536001802504536001102522650003002533650001902563650002002582650002202602650002202624650002502646650001302671650002102684650001902705650001902724650001702743710004802760710006002808710009002868720002702958720003102985720002603016720005403042856004603096OST1647434TOE20200818000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200813|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1647434  aTOEcTOE04aThe IsoGenie databaseh[electronic resource] :b an interdisciplinary data management solution for ecosystems biology and environmental research   aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

Here we introduce the IsoGenie Database, a de novo developed data management and exploration platform, as a solution to this challenge of accurately representing and integrating heterogenous environmental and microbial data across ecosystem scales. The IsoGenieDB is a public and private data infrastructure designed to store and query data generated by the IsoGenie Project, a ~10 year DOE-funded project focused on discovering ecosystem climate feedbacks in a thawing permafrost landscape. The IsoGenieDB provides (i) a platform for IsoGenie Project members to explore the project?s interdisciplinary datasets across scales through the inherent relationships among data entities, (ii) a framework to consolidate and harmonize the datasets needed by the team?s modelers, and (iii) a public venue that leverages the same spatially explicit, disciplinarily integrated data structure to share published datasets. The IsoGenieDB is also being expanded to cover the NASA-funded Archaea to Atmosphere (A2A) project, which scales the findings of IsoGenie to a broader suite of Arctic peatlands, via the umbrella A2A Database (A2A-DB). The IsoGenieDB?s expandability and flexible architecture allow it to serve as an example ecosystems database.  bSC0004632  b SC0010580  b NNX17AK10G  b AC02-05CH11231  b 2007?4547  b 2013?5562  b ABI #1759874  b #37904 a54 environmental sciences4 aGraph database4 aData management4 aEcosystem science4 aInterdisciplinary4 aInformation analysis4 aDatabase4 aIsogenie project4 aStordalen mire4 aBioinformatics4 aData science2 aLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

The approach combines a mechanical model and a set of measurements to estimate signals that are not available in the measurements, such as wind speed, thrust, tower position, and tower loads. The model is severalfold faster than real time and is intended to be run online, for instance, to evaluate real-time fatigue life consumption of a field turbine using a digital twin, perform condition monitoring, or assess loads for dedicated control strategies. The mechanical model is built using a Rayleigh?Ritz approach and a set of joint coordinates. We present a general method and illustrate it using a 2-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) model of a wind turbine and using rotor speed, generator torque, pitch, and tower-top acceleration as measurement signals. The different components of the model are tested individually. The overall method is evaluated by computing the errors in estimated tower-bottom-equivalent moment from a set of simulations. From this preliminary study, it appears that the tower-bottom-equivalent moment is obtained with about 10 % accuracy. The limitation of the model and the required steps forward are discussed.  bAC36-08GO283084 a49 ee - wind and water power program - wind (ee-4w)4 aLoad estimation4 aKalman filter4 aFatigue2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

The obtained result $\frac{1}{v_{g}} = 7.46 \pm 0.03$~ns/m , is then used to derive the value of the refractive index (n) and the Rayleigh scattering length ($\mathcal{L}$) for liquid argon in the VUV region. For $\lambda = 128$~nm we found $n= 1.357 \pm 0.001$ and $\mathcal{L}= (99.9 \pm 0.8$)~cm. Such information are of interest for a variety of experiment searching for rare events like neutrino and dark matter interactions. The derived quantities also represent key information for the theoretical models describing the propagation of scintillation light in liquid argon.  bAC02-07CH113594 a46 instrumentation related to nuclear science and technology4 a72 physics of elementary particles and fields2 aFermi National Accelerator Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

However, both wind speed and wind direction can change with height across the area swept by the turbine blades. A turbine aligned to hub-height winds might experience suboptimal or superoptimal power production, depending on the changes in the vertical profile of wind, also known as shear. Using observed winds and power production over 6 months at a site in the high plains of North America, we quantify the sensitivity of a wind turbine's power production to wind speed shear and directional veer as well as atmospheric stability. We measure shear using metrics such as <span class="inline-formula"><i>?</i></span> (the log-law wind shear exponent), <span class="inline-formula"><i>?</i><sub>bulk</sub></span> (a measure of bulk rotor-disk-layer veer), <span class="inline-formula"><i>?</i><sub>total</sub></span> (a measure of total rotor-disk-layer veer), and rotor-equivalent wind speed (REWS; a measure of actual momentum encountered by the turbine by accounting for shear). We also consider the REWS with the inclusion of directional veer, <span class="inline-formula">REWS<sub><i>?</i></sub></span>, although statistically significant differences in power production do not occur between REWS and <span class="inline-formula">REWS<sub><i>?</i></sub></span> at our site. When REWS differs from the hub-height wind speed (as measured by either the lidar or a transfer function-corrected nacelle anemometer), the turbine power generation also differs from the mean power curve in a statistically significant way. This change in power can be more than 70 <span class="inline-formula">kW</span> or up to 5 % of the rated power for a single 1.5 <span class="inline-formula">MW</span> utility-scale turbine. Over a theoretical 100-turbine wind farm, these changes could lead to instantaneous power prediction gains or losses equivalent to the addition or loss of multiple utility-scale turbines. At this site, REWS is the most useful metric for segregating the turbine's power curve into high and low cases of power production when compared to the other shear or stability metrics. Therefore, REWS enables improved forecasts of power production.  bAC36-08GO28308  b AGS-15540554 a49 ee - wind and water power program - wind (ee-4w)4 aWind energy4 aWind speed shear4 aDirectional veer4 aTurbine2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

Double differential distributions in rapidity ${y}$ and transverse momentum $p_{T}$ are obtained from a sample of 33M inelastic events. They allow to extrapolate the spectra to full phase space and to determine the mean multiplicity of both ${\Xi }{^-}$ and $\overline{\Xi }{^+} $. The rapidity and transverse momentum spectra are compared to transport model predictions. The ${\Xi }{^-} $ mean multiplicity in inelastic $p+p$ interactions at 158 $\hbox {Ge}\hbox {V}\!/\!c$ is used to quantify the strangeness enhancement in A+A collisions at the same centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair.  bAC02-07CH113594 a73 nuclear physics and radiation physics4 a72 physics of elementary particles and fields2 aFermi National Accelerator Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Assuming large central charge $c$ and a sparse spectrum, the leading contribution to this correlation function is the six-point Virasoro identity block - corresponding to each distinct pair of operators fusing into the identity and its descendants. We call this the star channel. One particular term in the star channel identity block is the stress tensor $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ (global) block, for which we derive an explicit expression. In the holographic context, this object corresponds to a direct measure of nonlinear effects in pure gravity. We calculate additional terms in the star channel identity block that contribute at the same order at large $c$ as the global block using the novel theory of reparametrizations, which extends the shadow operator formalism in a natural way. We investigate these blocks' relevance to quantum chaos in the form of six-point scrambling in an out-of time ordered correlator. Interestingly, the global block does not contribute to the scrambling mode of this correlator, implying that, to leading order, six-point scrambling is insensitive to the three-point graviton coupling in the bulk dual. Finally, we compare our findings with a different OPE channel, called the comb channel, and find the same result for the chaos exponent in this decomposition.  bSC0009988  b PHY-17489584 aConformal field theory4 aAds-cft correspondence4 aEffective field theories4 aStochastic processes2 aUnited States.

By yawing the upstream turbine with regard to the wind direction, one can potentially reduce the power losses of the downstream turbine and reduce the fatigue loads. The evolution of the wake depends on the pressure gradient within the near-wake region and the turbulent kinetic energy and must be incorporated in existing wake steering algorithms to provide an accurate estimation of the wake flow. This paper will show a first approach to implement a near-wake model and a turbulence model in the curled wake model within the controls-oriented framework FLORIS. The near-wake model is based on an analytical expression of the velocity profile to model the pressure gradient. Furthermore, two turbulence models are incorporated within the curled wake model based on a Gaussian-distribution and a mixing length formulation. The adapted curled wake model is then assessed with the measurement data acquired in the wind tunnel at ForWind ? University of Oldenburg. The evaluation of the models show good agreement for the velocity deficit and representation of the near-wake region. Furthermore, the turbulent kinetic energy behaved as expected in comparison to other work, showing a ring of high turbulent kinetic energy at non-yawed condition which is deflected to a curled shape at large yaw angles with the turbulence model based on a mixing length formulation.  bAC36-08GO28308  b 0325492H4 aWind energy4 aNear-wake model4 aTurbulence4 aFloris4 aWind turbines2 aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aUnited States.

Knowledge about microbial community composition, diversity, and functional metabolic capabilities aids in understanding and predicting petroleum biodegradation by microbial communities in situ and is therefore an important component of the petroleum spill response decision-making process. This study investigates the taxonomic composition of microbial communities in six different global basins where petroleum and gas activities occur. Shallow-water communities were strikingly similar across basins, while deep-water communities tended to show subclusters by basin, with communities from the epipelagic, mesopelagic, and bathypelagic zones sometimes appearing within the same cluster. Microbial taxa that were enriched in the water column in the Gulf of Mexico following the DWH spill were found across marine basins. Several hydrocarbon-degrading genera (e.g., Actinobacteria, Pseudomonas, and Rhodobacteriacea) were common across all basins. Other genera such as Pseudoalteromonas and Oleibacter were highly enriched in specific basins.  bAC05-00OR22725  b A13-0119-0014 aGenomics4 aMarine microbiology4 aMicrobial communities4 aMicrobial ecology4 aOil biodegradation2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aNational Science Foundation (U.S.).4spn1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aMiller, John I. 4aut1 aTechtmann, Stephen 4aut1 aJoyner, Dominique 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn2 aBP International4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/165127204035nam a22004453u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124086002800137088002100165086003600186088002900222245016200251260020400413300005200617500003900669500001600708500002400724500003200748500003400780500004100814500035900855520175501214536001902969650006502988650014903053650002903202650003603231710004803267710007203315710009003387720002303477720002203500720002103522856004603543OST1638956TOE20201012000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200922|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1638956  aTOEcTOE0 aE 1.99:arxiv:2005.08051  aarxiv:2005.080510 aE 1.99: fermilab-pub-20-297-cms  a fermilab-pub-20-297-cms00aCharge collection and electrical characterization of neutron irradiated silicon pad detectors for the CMS High Granularity Calorimeterh[electronic resource]  aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

It will provide detailed position, energy, and timing information on electromagnetic and hadronic showers in the immense pileup of the HL-LHC. The High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) will use 120-, 200-, and 300-$\mu\textrm{m}$ thick silicon (Si) pad sensors as the main active material and will sustain 1-MeV neutron equivalent fluences up to about $10^{16}~\textrm{n}_\textrm{eq}\textrm{cm}^{-2}$. In order to address the performance degradation of the Si detectors caused by the intense radiation environment, irradiation campaigns of test diode samples from 8-inch and 6-inch wafers were performed in two reactors. Characterization of the electrical and charge collection properties after irradiation involved both bulk polarities for the three sensor thicknesses. Since the Si sensors will be operated at -30 $^\circ$C to reduce increasing bulk leakage current with fluence, the charge collection investigation of 30 irradiated samples was carried out with the infrared-TCT setup at -30 $^\circ$C. TCAD simulation results at the lower fluences are in close agreement with the experimental results and provide predictions of sensor performance for the lower fluence regions not covered by the experimental study. All investigated sensors display 60$\%$ or higher charge collection efficiency at their respective highest lifetime fluences when operated at 800 V, and display above 90$\%$ at the lowest fluence, at 600 V.

It uses a tandem of electrostatic spectrometers working as magnetic adiabatic collimation combined with an electrostatic (MAC-E) filters. In the space between the pre-spectrometer and the main spectrometer, creating a Penning trap is unavoidable when the superconducting magnet between the two spectrometers, biased at their respective nominal potentials, is energized. The electrons accumulated in this trap can lead to discharges, which create additional background electrons and endanger the spectrometer and detector section downstream. To counteract this problem, ?electron catchers? were installed in the beamline inside the magnet bore between the two spectrometers. These catchers can be moved across the magnetic-flux tube and intercept on a sub-ms time scale the stored electrons along their magnetron motion paths. In this paper, we report on the design and the successful commissioning of the electron catchers and present results on their efficiency in reducing the experimental background.  bAC02-05CH11231  b 5A17PDA  b 05A17PM3  b 05A17PX3  b 05A17VK2  b 05A17WO3  b VH-NG-1055  b FG02-97ER41020  b FG02-94ER40818  b SC0004036  b FG02-97ER41033  b FG02-97ER41041  b SC0011091  b SC00193042 aLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Future changes to these physical Earth system attributes and their effects on agricultural yields are highly uncertain. United States agricultural producers will be affected by such changes whether they occur domestically or internationally (via international commodity markets). How important to U.S. agriculture are domestic changes due to climate compared to those occurring externally? Here we show that potential direct impacts to United States agriculture have financial impacts on U.S. producers that are roughly similar in magnitude but opposite in sign to impacts on U.S. producers due to changes in other parts of the world. This finding is robust across application of a wide range of potential future crop yield impacts applied to a multi-sector global integrated assessment model. Therefore, when examining country-specific impacts, it is necessary to model both the domestic and international impacts.  bAC05-76RL018304 aCrops4 aAgricultural irrigation4 aAgriculture4 aMaize4 aCereal crops4 aWheat4 aEarth systems4 aFinance2 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aSnyder, Abigail 4aut1 aCalvin, Katherine 4aut1 aClarke, Leon 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/165661302825nam a22004093u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124245018600137260019200323300005000515500003900565500001600604500003400620500006900654500004400723520112600767536001401893650003301907650001801940650002301958650003001981650003902011650001502050650001602065710006002081710009002141720002802231720003102259720003002290720004902320856004602369OST1657211TOE20200907000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200820|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1657211  aTOEcTOE00aGlycerol Is an Osmoprotectant in Two Antarctic <em>Chlamydomonas</em> Species From an Ice-Covered Saline Lake and Is Synthesized by an Unusual Bidomain Enzymeh[electronic resource]  aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

Recently, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Dunaliella salina were shown to make glycerol with an unusual bidomain enzyme, which appears to be unique to algae, that contains a phosphoserine phosphatase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Here we report that two psychrophilic species of Chlamydomonas (C. spp. UWO241 and ICE-MDV) from Lake Bonney, Antarctica also produce high levels of glycerol to survive in the lake?s saline waters. Glycerol concentration increased linearly with salinity and at 1.3 M NaCl, exceeded 400 mM in C. sp. UWO241, the more salt-tolerant strain. We also show that both species expressed several isoforms of the bidomain enzyme. An analysis of one of the isoforms of C. sp. UWO241 showed that it was strongly upregulated by NaCl and is thus the likely source of glycerol. These results reveal another adaptation of the Lake Bonney Chlamydomonas species that allow them to survive in an extreme polar environment.  bSC00191384 a59 basic biological sciences4 aChlamydomonas4 aGlycerol synthesis4 aPhosphoserine phosphatase4 aGlycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase4 aAntarctica4 aLake bonney2 aUnited States.

Further uncertainties in the cloud structure arise in the presence of biomass burning carbonaceous aerosol, as is the case over the southeast Atlantic Ocean, where biomass burning aerosol is transported from the African continent. As the aerosol plume progresses across the southeast Atlantic Ocean, radiative heating within the aerosol layer has the potential to alter the thermodynamic environment and therefore the cloud structure; however, limited work has been done to quantify this along the trajectory of the aerosol plume in the region. The deployment of the first Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF1) in support of the Layered Atlantic Smoke Interactions with Clouds field campaign provided a unique opportunity to collect observations of cloud and aerosol properties during two consecutive biomass burning seasons during July through October of 2016 and 2017 over Ascension Island (7.96° S, 14.35° W). Using observed profiles of temperature, humidity, and clouds from the field campaign alongside aerosol optical properties from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), as input for the Rapid Radiation Transfer Model (RRTM), profiles of the radiative heating rate due to aerosols and clouds were computed. Radiative heating is also assessed across the southeast Atlantic Ocean using an ensemble of back trajectories from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Idealized experiments using the RRTM with and without aerosols and a range of values for the single-scattering albedo (SSA) demonstrate that shortwave (SW) heating within the aerosol layer above Ascension Island can locally range between 2 and 8 K d<sup>-1</sup> depending on the aerosol optical properties, though impacts of the aerosol can be felt elsewhere in the atmospheric column. When considered under clear conditions, the aerosol has a cooling effect at the TOA, and based on the observed cloud properties at Ascension Island, the cloud albedo is not large enough to overcome this. Shortwave radiative heating due to biomass burning aerosol is not balanced by additional longwave (LW) cooling, and the net radiative impact results in a stabilization of the lower troposphere. However, these results are extremely sensitive to the single-scattering albedo assumptions in models.  bSC0012704  b SC00182744 a54 environmental sciences2 aBrookhaven National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

The aim of this paper is to construct accurate absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) suitable for classical (local) as well as nonlocal peridynamic (PD) diffusion models. The main focus of the present study is on the PD diffusion formulation. The majority of the PD diffusion models proposed so far are applied to bounded domains only. In this study, we propose an effective way to handle unbounded domains both with PD and classical diffusion models. For the former, we employ a meshfree discretization, whereas for the latter the finite element method (FEM) is employed. The proposed ABCs are time-dependent and Dirichlet-type, making the approach easy to implement in the available models. The performance of the approach, in terms of accuracy and stability, is illustrated by numerical examples in 1D, 2D, and 3D.  bAC05-00OR227254 aPeridynamic diffusion model4 aAbsorbing boundary conditions4 aNonlocal diffusion4 aCorrosion4 aUnbounded domain2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

However, charge screening from graphite bulk carriers significantly reduces the localization effect and hinders the observation of those magnetic states. Here, we use an ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope with a high magnetic field to observe the magnetic states of atomic vacancies in graphite generated by ion sputtering. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals localized states at the vacancies, which exhibit splitting at a certain magnetic field whose separation increases with the field strength. The transition is well described by the ?Anderson model,? which describes the emergence of localized magnetic states inside the metallic reservoir through electron?electron interaction. The interaction strength is estimated to be between 1 meV and 3 meV, which is supported by the density functional theory calculation.

However, achieving such rapid reductions may depend on early retirement of coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. Here, we analyze future fossil fuel electricity demand in 171 energy-emissions scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), evaluating the implicit retirements and/or reduced operation of generating infrastructure. Although IAMs calculate retirements endogenously, the structure and methods of each model differ; we use a standard approach to infer retirements in outputs from all six major IAMs and?unlike the IAMs themselves?we begin with the age distribution and region-specific operating capacities of the existing power fleet. We find that coal-fired power plants in scenarios consistent with international climate targets (i.e. keeping global warming well-below 2 °C or 1.5 °C) retire one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case. If plants are built to meet projected fossil electricity demand and instead allowed to operate at the level and over the lifetimes they have historically, the roughly 200 Gt CO<SUB>2</SUB> of additional emissions this century would be incompatible with keeping global warming well-below 2 °C. Thus, ambitious climate mitigation scenarios entail drastic, and perhaps un-appreciated, changes in the operating and/or retirement schedules of power infrastructure.  bAC05-76RL01830  b EAR-1639318  b S0NSSC17K04164 aClimate change4 aEnergy systems4 aPower plants4 aRepresentative concentration pathways4 aIntegrated assessment model4 aShared socioeconomic pathways4 aClimate policy2 aPacific Northwest National Laboratory (U.S.).4res2 aNational Science Foundation (U.S.).4spn1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aFofrich, Robert 4aut1 aTong, Dan 4aut1 aCalvin, Katherine 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/167362203878nam a22004693u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124245013700137260011900274300004900393500003900442500001600481500003400497500011300531500011800644500004300762500004300805520191700848536001902765536001502784650001802799650001302817650001702830650001402847650002702861650001802888650001202906710006002918710009002978720002803068720002403096720002303120720012303143720004803266720004803314856004603362OST1639784TOE20200820000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200814|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1639784  aTOEcTOE00aStability of Floodplain Subsurface Microbial Communities Through Seasonal Hydrological and Geochemical Cyclesh[electronic resource]  aOak Ridge, Tenn. :bDistributed by the Office of Scientific and Technical Information, U.S. Dept. of Energy,c2020  a Size: Article No. 338 :bdigital, PDF file.  aPublished through Scitech Connect.  a08/14/2020.  a"Journal ID: ISSN 2296-6463."  aTolar, Bradley B. ; Boye, Kristin ; Bobb, Callum ; Maher, Kate ; Bargar, John R. ; Francis, Christopher A. .  aSLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States).

These dynamics create seasonally transient redox conditions that drive biogeochemical transformations, which strongly modify groundwater quality. Microbial responses to changing hydrological conditions are perhaps the critical step connecting hydrology to geochemical transformations and groundwater quality, yet are not well understood. We aimed to address this knowledge gap by monitoring seasonal transitions at the U.S. Department of Energy legacy uranium ore processing site in Riverton, WY, through spring-summer-fall hydrological transitions. Our goal was to characterize the microbial community throughout the soil profile, down to the saturated aquifer, and observe its response to wet-dry transitions across a full season and compare to changes in geochemistry and hydrology. Next-generation sequencing was employed to identify biogeochemically-relevant microbial taxa based on the 16S rRNA gene; we found a broad diversity of microbial clades including taxa involved in sulfur and metal cycling, as well as nitrification. These data were paired with measurements of soil moisture, major nutrients and cations, and trace elements. Overall microbial community composition was dependent on soil depth or type, with seasonal effects only observed in the topsoil or subsurface aquifer. This finding indicates that microbial communities in the transiently-reduced center of the soil profile at the Riverton, WY site are remarkably stable, despite moisture and redox inversions. In addition, these communities likely impact the communities in surrounding soil horizons through export of metabolites and solutes as the water table rises and falls throughout the season.  bAC02-76SF00515  b SC00191194 aAlluvial soil4 a16s rrna4 aGeochemistry4 aHydrology4 aTerrestrial subsurface4 aRiparian zone4 aUranium2 aUnited States.

UGTs have shown promise as catalysts in the synthesis of glycosides for medical treatment. However, limited understanding at the molecular level due to insufficient biochemical and structural information has hindered potential applications of most of these UGTs. In the absence of experimental crystal structures, we employed advanced molecular modeling and simulations in conjunction with biochemical characterization to design a workflow to study five Group H Arabidopsis thaliana (76E1, 76E2, 76E4, 76E5, 76D1) UGTs. Based on our rational structural manipulation and analysis, we identified key amino acids (P129 in 76D1; D374 in 76E2; K275 in 76E4), which when mutated improved donor substrate recognition than wildtype UGTs. Molecular dynamics simulations and deep learning analysis identified structural differences, which drive substrate preferences. The design of these UGTs with broader substrate specificity may play important role in biotechnological and industrial applications. These findings can also serve as basis to study other plant UGTs and thereby advancing UGT enzyme engineering.  bAC05-00OR227254 a59 basic biological sciences2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aAkere, Aishat 4aut1 aChen, Serena 4aut1 aLiu, Xiaohan 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/164903202813nam a22003133u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124245010700137260021900244300003700463500003900500500001600539500003400555500012100589520143300710536001902143710004002162710008702202710009002289720002202379720002802401720002402429856004602453OST1657978TOE20200923000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200901|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1657978  aTOEcTOE00aCharacterization of the Benefit of APS Flash Coatings in Improving TBC Lifetimeh[electronic resource]  aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

A series of furnace cycle tests (FCTs) has been conducted at 1100 °C in air + 10% H<sub>2</sub>O to study the benefit of flash coatings on rod and disk alloy 247 specimens and provide a better mechanistic understanding of their benefit. Flash coatings of NiCoCrAlY and NiCoCrAlYHfSi both improved the FCT lifetime of rod specimens tested in 100-h cycles and disk specimens tested in 1-h cycles. In 1-h cycles, the NiCoCrAlY flash coating significantly outperformed an HVOF-only NiCoCrAlYHfSi bond coating and a NiCoCrAlYHfSi flash coating. Both flash coatings increased the bond coating roughness compared to HVOF. During exposure, the flash layer formed an intermixed alumina-metal layer that appeared to inhibit crack formation. Using a time series of observations, the lower Y + Hf content in the Y-only flash coating appeared to reduce Al consumption. The HVOF layer acted as a source of Al for the adjacent mixed zone. A second series of specimens included a fully APS bond coating where oxide had penetrated through the entire coating to the substrate after only 100, 1-h cycles and lifetime was similar to an HVOF-only bond coating. The inner HVOF layer with the outer APS flash coating prevented this complete penetration from occurring.  bAC05-00OR227252 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

Although instability issues have been previously noted, they are typically treated as model implementation issues rather than as underlying problems associated with the form of the governing equations. This study proposes a new reference slope form of the Saint-Venant equations to ensure smooth slope source terms and eliminate one source of potential numerical oscillations. It is shown that a simple algebraic transformation of channel geometry provides a smooth reference slope while preserving the correct cross-section flow area and the total Piezometric pressure gradient that drives the flow. The reference slope method ensures the slope source term in the governing equations is Lipschitz continuous while maintaining all the underlying complexity of the real-world geometry. The validity of the mathematical concept is demonstrated with the open-source Simulation Program for River Networks (SPRNT) model in a series of artificial test cases and a simulation of a small urban creek. Validation comparisons are made with analytical solutions and the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model. The new method reduces numerical oscillations and instabilities without requiring ad hoc smoothing algorithms.  bAC05-00OR227254 a54 environmental sciences2 aOak Ridge National Laboratory.4res1 aUnited States.bDept. of Energy.bOffice of Scientific and Technical Information4dst1 aYu, Cheng-Wei 4aut1 aHodges, Ben R. 4aut1 aLiu, Frank 4aut2 aUSDOE4spn40uhttp://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/166596703078nam a22004333u 4500001001100000003000400011005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066035001700107040001300124086003200137088002500169245014300194260022300337300005300560500003900613500001600652500002800668500003400696500022300730520117700953536001402130536001502144536002002159650002202179650002502201650001902226650001902245650003302264710004102297710009102338710009002429720002502519720002602544720002802570856004602598OST1656456TOE20200917000000.0m||||||||d|f||||||cr||| ||||||||201122e20200821|||     s|   f0|||||eng|d  a(TOE)1656456  aTOEcTOE0 aE 1.99:bnl-216297-2020-jaam  abnl-216297-2020-jaam02aA Co- and Ni-Free P2/O3 Biphasic Lithium Stabilized Layered Oxide for Sodium-Ion Batteries and its Cycling Behaviorh[electronic resource]  aWashington, D.C. :bUnited States.

Compared to the single P-type and O-type structures, biphasic P/O structures became a topic of interest thanks to improved performance. However, the added complexity complicates the understanding of the storage mechanism and the phase behavior is still unclear, especially over consecutive cycling. Here, we report on the properties biphasic P2(34%)/O3(60%) Na<sub>0.8</sub>Li<sub>0.2</sub>Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and its behavior at different states of charge/discharge. The material is composed of single phase O3 and P2/O3 biphasic particles. Sodium occupies the alkali layers, whereas lithium predominantly (95%) is located in the transition metal (TM) layer. An initial reversible capacity of 174 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> is delivered with a retention of 82% dominated by Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>4+</sup> along with contributions from oxygen and partial Mn<sup>3+</sup>/<sup>4+</sup> redox. Cycling leads to complex phase transitions and ion migration. The biphasic nature is nevertheless preserved with lithium acting as structure stabilizer.  bSC0012704  b 01DR18003  b PCI2018-0930684 a25 energy storage4 aSodium ion batteries4 aLayered oxides4 aEnergy storage4 aPositive electrode materials2 aBrookhaven National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.

The goal of this research project is to develop an understanding of the microstructures and deformation mechanisms that control shear banding in MGs, which will enable the development of MGs with enhanced plasticity. Two scientific objectives have been pursued. (1) Understand the underlying mechanisms of shear banding phenomena in presence of nanoscale heterogeneities in MGs. (2) Understand the evolution of MG heterogenous structure upon thermomechanical stimuli for plasticity enhancement through controlling and distributing multiple shear bands.  bSC00161644 a36 materials science4 aMetallic glasses, shear banding, multi-scale simulations2 aUnited States.

However, electronic correlations have so far been little investigated in Weyl semimetals (WSMs) by experiments. Here, we report a combined optical spectroscopy and theoretical calculation study on the strength and effect of electronic correlations in a magnet Co<sub>3</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>. The electronic kinetic energy estimated from our optical data is about half of that obtained from single-particle ab initio calculations in the ferromagnetic ground state, which indicates intermediate-strength electronic correlations in this system. Furthermore, comparing the energy and side-slope ratios between the interband-transition peaks at high energies in the experimental and single-particle-calculation-derived optical conductivity spectra with the bandwidth-renormalization factors obtained by many-body calculations enables us to estimate the Coulomb-interaction strength (U ~ 4 eV) in Co<sub>3</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>. Besides, a sharp experimental optical conductivity peak at low energy, which is absent in the single-particle-calculation-derived spectrum but is consistent with the optical conductivity peaks obtained by many-body calculations with U ~ 4 eV, indicates that an electronic band connecting the two Weyl cones is flattened by electronic correlations and emerges near the Fermi energy in Co<sub>3</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>. Our work paves the way for exploring flat-band-generated quantum phenomena in WSMs.  bSC00127044 a75 condensed matter physics, superconductivity and superfluidity2 aBrookhaven National Laboratory.4res2 aUnited States.
